Website hosted on [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/), coded in [Notepad++](//notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [glitch.com]([//glitch.com/])’s live editor. In addition to help documentation on those sites, I owe a lot to and highly recommend [this guide](//jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

Font family is [Alegreya Sans](//www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht), served from [Google Fonts](//fonts.google.com/?query=alegreya). I strongly recommend [Matthew Butterick’s <i>Practical Typography</i>](//practicaltypography.com/).
