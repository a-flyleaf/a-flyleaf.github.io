Tools of the trade, and other recommendations. (Nothing's sponsored, I just like these things and use them a lot.)

## stuff that made the site
- hosted with [GitHub&nbsp;Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with gratuitous use of [GitHub&nbsp;Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and the <5 entire things I know about the command line
- coded in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

### early resources
These helped me make the site back in 2019!
- [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) and its live editor was invaluable before I started using Jekyll and the localhost
- ["Hello World": GitHub quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)
- [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

These are more general resources that I used at the time; not so much anymore, but nonetheless decent:
- [old pages](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/a-flyleaf.github.io/search?q=layout%3A+default) use [Alegreya Sans](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht); initially served via [Google Fonts](privacy#google), later [self-hosted](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts)
- [PX to EM converter](http://pxtoem.com/) + [the typographic scale](https://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/); the former is less relevant in today's era of cross-device screwery, the latter is a bite-sized design lesson

## other stuff a-flyleaf uses
### for art & design
- drawing tools: primarily [FireAlpaca](https://firealpaca.com/) for desktop + [MediBang&nbsp;Paint](https://medibangpaint.com/en/) for iPad
	- occasionally [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), good olâ€™ MSPaint, and even actual real-life paper
- design reference: [Matthew Butterick's <i>Practical Typography</i>](https://practicaltypography.com/), 4&nbsp;years of graphic design school
- sitemaking shenanigans: [Lorem&nbsp;Ipsum generator](https://lipsum.com/), [Safe web fonts](https://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/fonts.html), [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

### for code
- [CloudCannon's Jekyll tutorials](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/jekyll-tutorial/getting-started/), particularly [the date formatting table](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/date-formatting/)
- [Liquid documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) + [API reference](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid)
- countless unsung heroes across the internet everywhere (read: whoever showed up in the search results), especially on StackOverflow; specific tutorials are often linked where used, if only in code comments

### for the computer/internet, in general
- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) with the following add-ons:
	- for security: [Facebook&nbsp;Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/) + [Privacy&nbsp;Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/) + [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/)  
	(wouldn't recommend the last one if you don't know what it's doing; *highly* recommend it if you do)
	- for never seeing another godforesaken advertisement again, and generally cleaning up websites with impunity: [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
	- for focus: [LeechBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/)
	- for the heck of it: [Wayback Machine](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wayback-machine_new/)
- whichever [frontends](privacy#nitter-piped) for giant data-munching sites I can scrounge up from the [open source trenches](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends)
