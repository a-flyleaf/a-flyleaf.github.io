Website hosted on [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/), coded in [Notepad++](//notepad-plus-plus.org/) and (in early stages) [glitch.com]([//glitch.com/])’s live editor. In addition to help documentation on those sites, I owe a lot to and highly recommend [these](//guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) [guides](//jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

Font family is [Alegreya Sans](//www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht), served ~~from [Google Fonts](//fonts.google.com/?query=alegreya)~~ locally\*. I make frequent use of the following resources: [Matthew Butterick’s <i>Practical Typography</i>](//practicaltypography.com/), [PX to EM](//pxtoem.com/), [the typographic scale](//spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/), and for testing purposes [Lorem Ipsum](//lipsum.com/).

\***July 23, 2022 update**: Fonts are now embedded into this layout courtesy [the google webfonts helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts); otherwise I've left this layout untouched for archival's sake. See [the "Privacy Policy"]({{site.url}}/privacy) for details.
