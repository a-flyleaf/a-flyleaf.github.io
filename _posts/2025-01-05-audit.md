*Audit.* Isn't that such a lively word?

...Uh, finally hit push on a bunch of changes from December. So I'm writing this less than a week into the new year, but don't be surprised if it doesn't go live until later :V

<!--more-->

----

Anyway, new year new whatever, no resolutions no gods no masters. But I've been revisiting various sub-sites and noting things that need fixing/updating/general-*doing* along the way, so!

## things done
- <b>a-flyleaf.github.io</b> (you are here):
	- pushed changes from December, as noted above
	- [sitemap]({{site.url}}/sitemap): added links to [blog slug](slugs) & [status]({{site.url}}/status) pages
- [<b>/artfight</b>]({{site.url}}/artfight): fixed assorted links
- [<b>/hello-world</b> (<span style="font-family:consolas,monospace;">404</span>)]({{site.url}}/hello-world)
	- pushed age-old commit to delete unused images
	- fixed broken image & links on the [status post mirror]({{site.url}}/hello-world/limbo)
	- moved relvant pages from my pre-github site on glitch.me to [this repository]({{site.url}}/hello-world/bonus/glitch-reboot)
- [<b>/omori</b>]({{site.url}}/omori):
	- minor [About page]({{site.url/omori/about) to account for not actually having touched the hikikomori run for over a year now
	- updated [Links page]({{site.url/omori/links)
	- corrected one (1) letter to make [the Heardle insanity log]({{site.url}}/omori/heardle) chronological, which it was always supposed to be
	- intentionally skipped the [art]({{site.url}}/omori/art), [meta]({{site.url}}/omori/meta), and [hrvatski]({{site.url}}/omori/hrvatski/kuci) pages bc I'd be here for 4 years minimum
- [<b>/toyshelf</b>]({{site.url}}/toyshelf): pushed old commit making minor fixes, made other extremely tiny changes
- [<b>/ygbtdm</b>]({{site.url}}/ygbtdm): also pushed an old commit with fixes, and also fixed more things
	- like the omorisite there is a <em style="text-transform:uppercase;">lot</em> here, so I didn't exactly go through everything page by page. *un*like the fansite, I've revisited this sucker intermittently and had a bunch of fixable things noted, yahoo

## things to do maybe possibly eventually
- <b>a-flyleaf</b>
	- desperately need to update the /projects page
	- convert [/shriblets]({{site.url/shriblets}}) to its own repo, trawl through & link pages throughout sub-sites there too
	- fonts folder & preview page, for stuff I ripped from google
- <b>artfight</b>: literally have not touched this since 2022; I have very little for 2023 and didn't participate in 2024, but like it's still Something
- <b>omori</b>: finish moodboards and Put Them Somewhere
- <b>toyshelf</b>
	- figure out how to retroactively configure the /newhell stuff, among other stuff in the to-do text file
	- move lato from this repo to a-flyleaf, re-link accordingly
	- put the timeline somewhere maybe
	- disaster crew "links" sequence that basically conveys the whole 2012 timeline in the form of Toyhouse-esque character relationship summaries. this is like... half-written? it's decently far along but needs to be like, Finishedâ„¢
- <b>ygbtdm</b>: figure out wtf to do with all the miscellaneous stuff buried in /misc.... there's a TON of pages all over this repo that could get rounded & cleaned up, or at *least* linked on a future shriblets repo (see below)

### sites that don't exist yet
- <b><i>TFE</i></b>: a bulk of this "site" already exists; need to add in bonus gallery stuff and decide if & how I want to dump the remainder of the document/commentary/whatever. and also put stuff on the homepage/about lol
- RP hell gallery? straight to neocities with that one, I don't anticipate future updates

### not site-related
*for the love of god I haven't made a yearly art summary since 2022. or a monthly roundup since 2023. help*
