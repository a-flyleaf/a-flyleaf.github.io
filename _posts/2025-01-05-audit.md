*Audit.* Isn't that such a lively word?

...Uh, finally hit push on a bunch of changes from December. So I'm writing this less than a week into the new year, but don't be surprised if it doesn't go live until later :V

Anyway, new year new whatever, no resolutions no gods no masters. But I've been revisiting various sub-sites and noting things that need fixing/updating/general-*doing* along the way, so!

## things done
- <b>a-flyleaf</b> (you are here):
	- pushed changes from December, as noted above
	- [sitemap]({{site.url}}/sitemap): added links to [blog slug](slugs) & [status]({{site.url}}/status) pages

## things to do maybe possibly eventually
- <b>a-flyleaf</b>
	- desperately need to update the /projects page
	- convert [/shriblets]({{site.url/shriblets}}) to its own repo, trawl through & link pages throughout sub-sites there too
- <b><i>TFE</i></b>: a bulk of this "site" already exists; need to add in bonus gallery stuff and decide if & how I want to dump the remainder of the document/commentary/whatever. and also put stuff on the homepage/about lol
- RP hell gallery? straight to neocities with that one, I don't anticipate future updates
