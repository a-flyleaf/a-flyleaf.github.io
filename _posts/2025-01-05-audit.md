*Audit.* Isn't that such a lively word?

...Uh, finally hit push on a bunch of changes from December. So I'm writing this less than a week into the new year, but don't be surprised if it doesn't go live until later :V  
<i>[update 1/08: lol]</i>

<!--more-->

Anyway, new year new whatever, no resolutions no gods no masters. But I've been revisiting various sub-sites and noting things that need fixing/updating/general-*doing* along the way, so!

## things done
- <b>a-flyleaf.github.io</b> (you are here):
	- pushed changes from December, as noted above; includes [the previous blog post](fine-great)
	- [sitemap]({{site.url}}/sitemap): added links to [blog slug](slugs) & [status]({{site.url}}/status) pages
	- it's 2025 now! updated homepage & footer year accordingly
	- moved page redirects to the relevant folder (backend only)
	- [privacy]({{site.url}}/privacy): edited the frontend section (RIP Nitter, Piped, Invidious... yikes)
- [<b>/artfight</b>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/artfight): fixed assorted links
- [<b>/hello-world</b> (<span style="font-family:consolas,monospace;">404</span>)](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/hello-world):
	- pushed age-old commit to delete unused images
	- fixed broken image & links on the [status post mirror](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/hello-world/limbo)
	- moved relvant pages from my pre-github site on glitch.me to [this repository](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/hello-world/bonus/glitch-reboot)
- [<b>/omori</b>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori):
	- [About](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/about): minor copyedit, to account for not actually having touched the hikikomori run for over a year now
	- [Links](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/links): added repo where some madlad just reuploaded half the assets folder
	- corrected one (1) letter to make [the Heardle insanity log](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/heardle) chronological, which it was always supposed to be
	- intentionally skipped the [art](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/art), [meta](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/meta), and [hrvatski](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/hrvatski/kuci) pages bc I'd be here for 4 years minimum
- [<b>/toyshelf</b>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/toyshelf): pushed old commit making minor fixes, made other extremely tiny changes
- [<b>/ygbtdm</b>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm):
	- pushed old commit with assorted fixes
	- [cast](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm): fixed broken links in character image captions
		- a similar relative link issue probably exists throughout the gallery since I can't check that properly on the localhost. we'll see if I ever get to combing through those, though; like the omorisite, this repository is huge and I didn't scour each individual page.
	- fixed a couple links in the [April Fool's special](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/carless)---which also necessitated making a behind-the-scenes roadmap because wtf past me. how did I keep track of all those files. hyperfocus is a heck of a thing *what was i <strong style="font-weight:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">on</strong>*
	- aaand made other minor corrections which I didn't keep track of. that's what commit history is for.

## things to do maybe possibly eventually
- <b>a-flyleaf</b>:
	- desperately need to update the [/projects]({{site.url}}/projects) page
	- convert [/shriblets]({{site.url}}/shriblets) to its own repo, trawl through & link pages throughout sub-sites there too
	- fonts folder & preview page, for stuff I ripped from google. might be better to make this its own repository?
- <b>artfight</b>: literally have not touched this since 2022; I have very little for 2023 and didn't participate in 2024, but like it's still Something... maybe I'll get to it if I play again this year
- <b>omori</b>: finish moodboards and Put Them Somewhere
- <b>toyshelf</b>:
	- figure out how to retroactively configure the /newhell stuff, among other stuff in the to-do text file
	- move Lato from this repo to a-flyleaf, re-link accordingly
	- put the timeline somewhere maybe
	- disaster crew "links" sequence that basically conveys the whole 2012 timeline in the form of Toyhouse-esque character relationship summaries. this is like... half-written? it's decently far along but needs to be, y'know, Finishedâ„¢
- <b>ygbtdm</b>: figure out wtf to do with all the miscellaneous stuff buried in /misc.... there's a TON of pages all over this repo that could get rounded & cleaned up, or at *least* linked on the aforementioned hypothetical future shriblets repo

### sites that don't exist yet
- <b><i>TFE</i></b>: a bulk of this "site" already exists; need to add in bonus gallery stuff and decide if & how I want to dump the remainder of the document/commentary/whatever. and also put stuff on the homepage+about lol
- RP hell gallery? straight to neocities with that one, I don't anticipate future updates

### not site-related
*for the love of god I haven't made a yearly art summary since 2022. or a monthly roundup since 2023. help*

there should no longer be changes sitting on my machine from 5ever ago yaayyyyy

<br>
<small>+note: as this is super informal and mostly only makes sense to me, I'm not noting it on the site status. also like, I *just* pushed the commit that put the last post on the homepage :V no need to dethrone it so hastily.</small>
