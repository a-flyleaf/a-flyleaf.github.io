So, it's been almost two years. Since launching this site I have done a whole lotta nothing with it, although <!--more-->it's hiding [a hasty art showcase](/art) and (by <span class="sc">url</span>, not on GitHub) a couple other repositories I've done slightly more with. Go figure.

In any case, I've had some personal character development, and you know what? No, forget the portfolio. I've been paralyzed by perfectionism for *two gosh dang years*. This is *my* website and I do what I want with it. And so as of this writing, I'm just gonna make a new page for my projects, and from there on it's time to make this place my own.

Also, I need a new layout, but that's not top priority; it won't necessarily look too different from this one, anyway. Main issues are that the current one isn't too HTML-view-friendly (seriously, all the links as plaintext in a span with no actual spacing??), the link boundaries & spacing are weird, and it could maybe use a dark theme. But for now, this one Works, and that's enough.
