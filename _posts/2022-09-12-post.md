It took me a solid ~5 minutes of running Jekyll, closing it, clearing the cache, restarting, rinse and repeat, before I realized this post wasn't showing up because I was refreshing my live blog page and not the localhost.

Anyway, assorted musings with minimal relation.<!--more-->

Ages ago I subscribed to a developer's email newsletter; checking my message history reminds me that I was probably aiming to take his JavaScript course. (A majority of these emails are unread.) For whatever reason, the one pictured above, "Designing a focus style," was singled out among Gmail's automatic tabs---and there it languished, unopened, since being sent in 2019. Because I thought it was about making your own time management technique, and figured I'd read it later.

I opened it recently just for the hell of it, even though I had no intention of sitting down and brainstorming a new time management technique.

I feel like this is one of those things that characterizes me as a person.

## blog-blogging
It's dawned on me recently that my deviantArt descriptions are the closest thing I have right now to a *blog*, in terms of updating the public on my life and pursuits and such. On one hand this is fine; I'm content shouting to a void, don't want all my personal beeswax\* out there for the world to see, privacy etc. etc.

<aside>(*I was going to make a joke about this idiom aging me but it seems to exist entirely in the context of one particular book. Which still ages me, actually. Since when was this a musical???)</aside>

On the other hand, it's deviantArt, and there were a good few hours a while back where all descriptions suddenly appeared to disappear. With all the promotions and monetization ads being shoved in my face throughout the site, I should really not rely on it for a reliable archive of my art and associated description-writing.

I rely on it anyway because #hashtagConvenience. Damn the bugger. I'm getting better at sitebuilding, so maybe someday, but not today.

Today, though, this exists.

### oh yeah, the main thing I wanted to get at by bringing this up
Last month I didn't draw much so my [roundup](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-08-2022-shortest-roundup-EVAR-928145235) was one of the shortest since I started doing roundups. But I stil *did* a lot of digital work, just in Blender and/or [site-related](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/changelog)! It's just not the kind of thing that lends itself to what are essentially sketchdump-collages.

Relatedly, it irks me somewhat that, while I've made an effort to caption images throughout ↑ that site (and [<i class="four">404</i>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/hello-world) before it, albeit to a lesser and much less convenient\* extent), I haven't tackled the roundups because there's just *so much*. And with some I've ended up making copies for [*another* site](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/toyshelf), which is needlessly redundant. Couldn't I just make one main version right here, in a new repository or wherever, and code in some subject toggles & transcribe as I go along?

<aside markdown="1">\*(No, seriously, how did I *survive* writing individual panel descriptions in [*include HTML*](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/hello-world/blob/master/2-debug/1.html), page-specific data is Right There. (I'd link a recent sample to exemplify the latter, if said link didn't have a high chance of breaking as I figure out navigation... but take a [repository gander](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/ygbtdm), the raw colorscript code is in there somewhere.)

...Yes, code imrovement is a tricky thing to show off, and makes zero sense to the unitiated. hashtag i try.)
</aside>

Anyway, *could* I recode a roundup from the ground up? Probably. Although right now I'm still struggling to find a good compromise between integrating images with typed text vs keeping things responsive ([latest attempt](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/cast/designnotes) is either one-column responsive or full non-responsive, with no in-between), which I'd definitely want to figure out beforehand... namely because

1. even though handwriting all the notes takes me forever, I think it adds a fun personal element that gets completely obliterated with typed text <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">but</em> then I'm just writing *and* typing things, which kinda defeats the point; and
1. sometimes when putting sketches together some funny juxtapositions happen, which can prompt doodles of their own, and that gets lost if everything turns into one column! even if two-column sucks on a tiny screen, which *also* deeats the point of bothering to make it mobile-friendly!!

Maybe the solution will just be to keep saying to hell with "mobile" designs and forcing everything to be the same size, with pixels. The handwriting thing will unfortunately be either lost or redundant regardless (unless I make a font of it or something, which... eh? not *off* the table but I *would* want to get more in-depth with it than what generators spit out, didn't take a typography class for nothing), but at least there'd be *some* semblance of a linear document flow. Oh, and the toggles and potential zoom-ins and all that good stuff. That was the main thing.

## speaking of site/art stuff
Describing images is a heck of a thing sometimes. Like, the image earlier in this post is straightforward---<code>Screenshot of an unread Gmail message from Zell Liew, titled “Designing a focus style” and dated to October 2nd, 2019.</code> Utilitarian. To-the-point. That's all it needs to be. If the URL broke, nothing significant would be lost.

Inevitably, though, accessibility calls for image descriptions, and that means *art* descriptions, and like... I don't know, you *could* be utilitarian with it. "Woman smiling mysteriously" or "Painted portrait of a woman with a mysterious smile, on a natural background" or "[insert in-depth physical description of the woman to the point where it starts to sound mildly creepy, the kind of indulgent trait-listing a novelist would gawk at, never mind the rest of the details]" is *objectively* correct, but they don't convey the *essence* of [the thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa).

And sure, picture's worth a thousand words, even utilitarian images [can be captioned differently depending how they're used](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#context).

But the point of a *visual* is that it can convey an entire idea in an instant---the drama of [chiaroscuro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro), the humbling of a [downshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-angle_shot). Inherently, reading cannot do this. Prose is, well, *wordy*; poetry gets close but it's not the same.

Of course, it doesn't *have* to be the same. It's just... something something *essence,* it gets me thinking about the nature of a piece (of writing, of visual art) and how many ways the same exact idea can be conveyed, and also [I just found this "Alt Text as Poetry" project](https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/) while searching for something to link for the "captions can be different" text above, and that site looks *extremely* relevant to my interests and I lost my train of thought a bit.

Oh, and comics as a medium already deal with text/image integration, but potentially also run into a similar "losing something if it's a font" problem as the aforementioned colorscript thing, and. Yeah.

<strong style="text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:normal;">Art.</strong>

## one more philosophy-adjacent art thign
Main reason I'm writing a blog post at all today is actually to save a comment I just left on a video, because I don't know if I'll ever get around to writing a Comprehensive Post™ about the topic but it *is* interesting and YouTube comment sections are an ephemeral wasteland.

Run-on aside.

Brief context: Discovered [Royal Skies](https://www.youtube.com/c/RoyalSkiesLLC) during recent dives into Blender hell, and as an unsolicited + unsponsored side note those tutorials are *extremely heckin great.* I am typically loathe to watch videos when whatever they're saying could've been an article, because time-based media is cool but for instructional purposes *skimming is cooler*. Video tutorials will almost inevitably be paused along the way, and the time adds up quick when there's like, 30 minutes for one (1) task.

*But anyway.*

Blender tutorials aren't the only thing on the channel, and lately the guy\* has been making a series on [AI art](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZpDYt0cyiuvYyzuXDjRlplWe8n0FLf-X), currently with a focus on [Dall-E](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZpDYt0cyiuvl-Rz1s4tJbnqTO5RzLT10). Some of these "tutorials" are short enough to get snatched up by the YouTube Shorts thing---read, under 30 seconds long. Because you're typing in prompts, waiting for it the load, and *bam*, ya done. 

<aside>(*I don't know if there's a distinction between "Royal Skies [guy recording and narrating the videos]" and "Royal Skies [channel name]" (says a-flyleaf at a-flyleaf.github.io))</aside>

I don't really have a strong opinion on AI art, as a concept, right now. It's a cool novelty, I guess? I don't think it's *the death of the art world* or other handwring-y sentiments, although (from my extremely cursory knowledge) there are extremely valid concerns about the algorithms reflecting human biases (what else is new) and machines replacing jobs (what, *genuinely*, else is new). We don't have good answers to these things yet, but we truck ahead with the tech anyway, as we do. Hell, we don't have a good "answer" to the *car* yet. But I digress.

[Here's the video I commented on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvoU9pi0vHI), and here's the comment:
> Man, watching as a casual digital image-maker (usually draw, trying to get into 3d—hence finding this channel!), I think this stuff is fascinating. Started watching these as something of a morbid curiosity, initially not thinking of AI ~art (AI-generated imagery, whatever you want to call it) as more than a novelty, but there’s clearly <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">some</em> degree of skill involved in making it—even if the type of skill is more akin to an image search than physical dexterity. And I *would* argue there’s skill, or at least specialized knowledge, involved in database- or in this case algorithm-searching; for instance, finding references for odd poses or objects can be a *huge* time-suck—and even outside the realm of images, compare “how do i become an artist quickly” to “beginner drawing tutorial fundamentals [with a time filter for, say, under 10 minutes]”.
>
> Like, look at all the words in the final query here; you need to do <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">some</em> research to know the camera specifics (30mm?), *why* it’s important to specify it… *I* can discern why the “trending on Nike website” part might be important, because I know a bit about commercial web design; web designers need to account for mobile devices, so the images need to be even bolder and simpler than even a poster (size is set, can be huge) or commercial (implies video, things can move in/out of focus). But I have no clue why 30mm is the camera setting of choice! You’d need, I assume, at *least* cursory know-how of advertising photography for that.
>
> Anyway, especially after reading some of the comment backlash (which has more to do with the mere *concept* of AI than anything actually being presented in a How To Use AI Tutorial—valid concerns, but imo kiiind of besides the point?), just wanted to pop in and say it’s really cool to see how this stuff actually works. You’ve definitely got me reconsidering my initial dismissal of AI-generated imagery and the ~nature of art~ and all that philosophical stuff, even if that’s *also* besides the point :P Genuinely curious to see what the rest of the series has in store, and thanks for making such concise tutorials in general!

(N.b., I rarely log in to YouTube. And I am definitely not getting into comment fights. It's an interesting topic worth discussion, though, so feel free to reply there and/or [hit me up through some other way]({{site.url}}/about#contact). I'll, uh, get to it when I get to it. ~~*probably* not in 3 years.~~)

Anywho, something I didn't mention in the comment (because it would be so *so* very besides the point that all my parentheses and asides would become a self-consuming black hole of tangents) is that I was reminded of my image-describing struggle. Seriously, [look at this](https://youtu.be/dvoU9pi0vHI?t=99):

<figure><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/blog/prompt-engineer.png"><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/blog/prompt-engineer.png" alt="Screenshot of a diagram in the video; context described below."/></a></figure>

A "prompt engineer" uses roughly *nine* attributes for best image-generation results: mood/emotion, quality, camera lens, source (where the image might be found), description, subject, setting, purpose, and destination. I think that shit's fascinating!!

Of course, that's how the AI "gets" it. And a human reader can understand the patterns being matched here, more or less---although, as mentioned (e.g. the camera lens thing), not necessarily *why*.

And for art, maybe some of these details just aren't important? Narrative, I'm thinking narrative; "city sidewalk at night, Dutch angle" doesn't mean anything if you don't know [what a Dutch angle is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_angle), and even then, what do you know except "conveys tension"? It's a technique, and the *why* is more important than execution. Are Dutch angles used at key scenes to hint at the presence of a specific character, or did the artist/cinematographer just want to sprinkle in some drama? "City sidewalk at night, Dutch angle" ≠ "Night. Crooked city; keep your head down." The latter evokes *an* image, even if it's not the exact same as the one that's been drawn.

I rewrote that last paragraph several times. Figuratively I am banging my fists on the table in a repeated gesture of undirected enthusiasm. Art talk! Art in general!! *Describing* art, the way words are objective and yet not---frustrating, fascinating, I love it and I hate it and that's why I write walls like this!!! *God!!!!*

### P.S. on the AI thing
Again, no strong opinion on AI art as a concept (ignoring socioeconomic factors, or at least trying to, for the time), whether it can "truly" be considered "art." But a lot of arguments *against* it--- I mean, I haven't done a deep dive, but the aforementioned comment backlash and similar sentiments... It Don't Sit Right. So here's some more Thoughts™, in a place that will not get me immediately dogpiled:

- It's not useful to conflate "this is a disaster for skilled jobs in the industry" with "the very notion of AIs making 'art' is an affront to the idea of (how I personally am defining) art." The former is an ethical + economic concern; the latter is philosophical.
- I'm inclined to think the idea that AI art will *replace* human artists is catastrophizing. Will *some* studios ditch illustrators for (I do not like this term I will admit) "prompt engineers"? Probably, definitely. To the untrained eye the human touch is indiscernible; even *to* the trained eye, AIs are getting better. The question isn't *if* AI art will be able to mimic a professional level, but *when*; arguably, it already has. But Photoshop hasn't made painters or photographers obsolete.
	- Job insecurity is being skimmed over here, yes. My dismissive handwave is "when is that *not* an issue" but I'll admit that it is *a handwave* and not at all a good argument. I don't know enough about economics to comment in-depth.
- Talk about "this isn't art, it's fake" always reminds me of arguments against, say, [Dadaist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada) and other modern/conceptual art. [<i>The Art Assignment</i>](https://www.youtube.com/c/theartassignment) has some really good videos on this; my (much more informal) opinion is that I fucking love weird/surreal/modernist stuff, I love [the shark box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physical_Impossibility_of_Death_in_the_Mind_of_Someone_Living), I love people asking what "art" even means. So "it doesn't count if it's by an AI" is a moot point to me. (Besides, ever heard of [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_art)? Howsabout [creative coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding)? [Computer art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_art) is *huge*; we've been using tech to make art since we've had, well, tech.)

Arguably one of the biggest elephants (AIlephants?) in the room is the idea that AI art is "stolen," because it's been trained on All Of The Images, regardless of whether the image creators gave permission for it. (Boy, copyright ethicists are gonna have a *swell* time if we ever manage to bring people back from the dead. <i>Starry Night</i> print, anyone?)

Tongue-in-cheek wild hypotheticals aside, though... Well, [Royal Skies already made a video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQZAlMqy7wI), and he argues that it's not theft because the AI is pattern-matching & creating something entirely original *based on* those patterns; there's no copy-pasting going on here. It's not even collaging in the "throw a bunch of fruits in a blender and *let it rip*" sense, it's more like watching 5,000 fruit smoothie tutorials and then winging it based on what you keep seeing people use.

Personally, I found that pretty convincing. But also, I just have a very lax approach to how art is "owned" on the internet in general. (No, I'm not talking about NFTs; I think those are silly [(and no help to the environment, to boot)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token#Environmental_concerns).\*) Look, I grew up with "original character *do not steal*" descriptions and copyright disclaimers in fanfic and giant watermarks plastered everywhere (I *still* see giant watermarks!), and if there's one thing that the internet has made very clear it's that it is a *very public* space. Anyone can and will use anything on it, at any time, for better and for worse and for everything in-between.

<aside markdown="1">(\*Buuut I am also an avid petsite user, where we all like to pretend we "own" our little pixel animals, when if the site crashed forever tomorrow no one would be any the wiser. There are hairs to be split here but generally, I'm sympathetic to the "I (want to) own this thing I did not make, and could not prevent from disappearing or changing" idea.

That said, I don't endorse NFTs of my work. Can't you just right-click → Save as...?)
</aside>

Also, more generally, I think that **everything is derivative**. The most "original" ideas are still synthesized from previously-experienced work; nothing is invented in a vacuum, not common objects and *definitely* not the kinds of creative work people would typically call "art." (As in, you could definitely argue there's an art to product design. But *most* people's definition of "art" includes, say, paintings. And guess what? Both derivative!)

*That all being said:* You realistically cannot prevent your work from being scanned by the AIgorithm unless you never share it publicly anywhere ever, and even *then* who's to stop the rogue reposter. (Which is an issue in its own right but I've digressed how many times now? Yeah, maybe another post.) At any rate, I don't think artwork being scanned by the pattern-detecting gods should be any more of an issue than a real human being taking stylistic inspiration from a favorite artist. The derivative thing is a machine this time, not a human, but... imo, so what?

And, yes, I acknowledge that "style theft" is something some artists push back against anyway. Heck if I know what's going through their heads, frankly. Personally, as long as there's no money being made off copying some indie rando, I got no issue with it.

TL;DR AI isn't "stealing" anything, objectively, and on a concept level I got no beef. If I knew more about how any of this works I'd be tempted to train an AI on my own art, frankly; I think that would be *fucking hilarious*.

Section TL;DR: I don't know if I *love* AI-generated imagery but I don't think it's a bogeyman, and don't buy the arguments I've seen about it being "stolen" or "not art."

Also, on static blog posts, no one can pick an internet fight with you (directly, anyway).

## one very last thing for this monster of a post
One of these days I want to make a follow-up to [the "Tale of Two Projects" post]({{site.url}}/blog/project-rambling), but the most pertinent things I don't want to forget to note:

- At the time of writing I had ~recently discovered [Ranfren](https://ranfren.neocities.org/), which seemed like prime <i class="four">404</i> inspiration material. Not like I've stayed on top of it since (or even ever got around to reading it start to current), but I appreciate the "what the fuck is even going on" of the website.
- I had also, more continually-relevantly, recently finished reading [Oliver Burkemann's <i>Four Thousand Weeks</i>](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/01/four-thousand-weeks-by-oliver-burkeman-review-a-brief-treatise-on-time), because every so often I like to read sobering pop psychology books that make me want to change my life for a few weeks before the status quo sets back in. That said, I *still* think about it a lot.
- Just under nine months later (that's baby time, what the fuck), what I have to "show for" the story idea is [a whole site](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/)---a "beta" document turned glorified gallery, more recently including character info, and a bunch of pages that are sitting around the repository but not published yet. Also colorscripts, which I have yet to publicize because the perfectionist bug bites me still. But really, even if I only had like one (1) new drawing and a paperclip, I need to be less hard on myself <span style="display:inline-block;">:V</span>

*Okay phew holy shit I think I'm done here,* 147 code-lines and counting. I guess this *could* have been separate posts after all, but I still have this nagging idea that Posts About Particular Things need to be all cleaned-up and essay like. Using my blog as a sporadic but relatively-unfiltered public journal is clearly a better idea.

I'm, uh, workin' on it. Thanks for reading if you made it this far, have a virtual fistbump. 👊
