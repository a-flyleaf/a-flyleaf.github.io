it dawns on me, not *in*frequently, that the posts I find myself revisiting most often here (yes I do love gazing into [the pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(Caravaggio)) what about it) are the weird ones. the off-the-cuff ones. like what the fuck was I on when I wrote [this [untitled internet screed]](screed). at least I remember the IRL context to [this ["not much"]](moment); and in a similar vein, I still think [the would-be follow-up](lastday) is trying too hard.

the ones I care the least for are the ones I put... I don't want to say Effortâ„¢, it's not like the smaller things *don't* take some degree of energy and thought. but like, I actually don't care about the 5,000-word diatribe against social media or whatever. it is vastly more likely than the other stuff to get me a Good Grade in Blogging but like who the fuck cares also

if "growing up" is figuring out what *you* are, what *you* like doing, external expectations be damned, then... I am still very clueless in a lot of regards, and I *like* being seen as witty and amusing and all that jester shit, and I write to amuse *myself* a non-small amount, too. "portfolio (professional persona, wears a suit to zoom lectures) [versus] hobbies [(slug, draws on the wall with crayon)](projected-hands)" is probably one of my favorite things I've written and like what do I even call that, it's not even a memoir it's just throwing words to the void until, as titled, I got bored

idk. [shit is inevitable](https://choodraws.tumblr.com/post/120695153363) but we're getting somewhere, if only because time marches inexorably on.
