## patch notes
- [/status page]({{site.url}}/status) is now HTML for better responsiveness
- site-wise, that's basically it.
- like stuff has been happening ~behind-the-scenes~ but I think for my own sanity I am not even going to so much as tease at it, and it gets published when it gets published

disconnected thoughts.

I am slightly over 25, set to be slightly *more* over the quarter in about a month. I have reached the point of my life at which I am, apparently, writing fanfiction of my fanfiction—diving back into the carcass of old stories and going, well, it did alright at XYZ, but kind of poorly at ABC; but what if instead of trying to fix ABC, we left it at that, and used the whole alphabet as the foundation for !@#interrobang?

Incidentally, I’ve found my latest Obsession Character has a few traits in common with one of my first, and so do all those in between, and really, this is no coincidence whatsoever. Something something each person ultimately has one Big Story to tell, and every single thing they ever produce is a variation on that theme. I do not remember where I first read that sentiment, only that I have, and that it stuck with me.

/When I Win The World Ends/ is a good story. It is a pokemon fanfiction, and it is also a good story. I recommend it.

A few months ago, in August, it dawned on me I’d been in the RP vortex for a year to the date. This was a slightly sobering realization, and not, admittedly, an entirely happy one. As previously written, *every single other hobby* of mine effectively got put on abrupt hold, as the new shiny took over my life. In some ways this is common with me; I know my brain works (and tends to feel!) best when it has something to latch onto, whether that be a new piece of media, my own writings, a game….

I went through my iCloud backup recently, as it’s been screeching at me intermittently to clear my storage since 2020, and there is a jarring and abrupt dearth of Images from, y’know, August 2023 onward. Likewise, my public art and website-update output has also ground to an effective standstill.

I don’t love that! It’s not even about :sparkles:being productive:sparkles: at that point; I *like* to look into my own godforesaken pool. I do this for *me*. I don’t regret the RP era at all—arguably, it’s not over, even as I’m stepping belatedly back—but *my god, @self, where is the STUFF.*

An interesting writing technique I picked up from a friend through RP is the use of text formatting to convey meaning. Which isn’t new, exactly; I’ve experimented with it [here](a quick one? 404 rudy page?) and [there](blog post with the omoribox “AAAAAA”) before. Speech bubbles, comics, integration of text and image in thereof and elsewhere—all continually relevant and recurring thoughts for me.

What interested me about *this* particular technique

[right]is its disjointedness,[/right]

the way it forces your eyes to dart from one end

(r) to the other

and back again,

(center) occasionally with a respite, but not much.

The RPer uses it to convey a character’s frayed and frenzied thoughts, to a *remarkably* poignant degree. Or, in less pretentious terms, *it fucking slaps*.

[in a div]And yes, as an aside, the format is *slightly* constrained on smaller screens.

But it’s not

(r) *not*

noticeable, especially in shorter lines.
[/div]

And throw in <color>, and all bets are off.

Who needs speech bubbles, I wonder, when the decorative qualities of text are ***(big, impact?)right there***? It falters on screenreaders, which is as ever its own concern, but even there I *believe* there’s

a pause

with each new paragraph, and that’s got to count for something. Translation from the visual to the audial (well, translation in *general,* really) always necessitates some compromise.
