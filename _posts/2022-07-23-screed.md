The internet is so fucking stupid (complimentary).
<!--more-->

I love you overdramatic threatening "if you even *think* in this direction I'll put tacks on all your chairs" terms I love you dead doves I love you people who project on their OCs shamelessly and flagrantly I love you stuck-up asswipes who have conniptions at the slightest whiff of constructive criticism I love you people who keep themselves awake at night developing a character maybe two other people will ever know about I love you OC playlists I love you weirdass "blorbo" and "scrungly" and whatever other slang kids are using these days I love you self-righteous fuckwads who will literally burn down my house someday if given the opportunity because I said characters are puppets made of sand I love you people who write and draw the most heinous shit known to man that gets spread among group chats because if one person had to witness it so does everyone else I love touching grass I love people who need to <em style="font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">touch</em> grass I love all this stupid fucking trivial bullshit that matters to no one ever anywhere who hasn't touched these weird little corners with a 50-foot pole (good for them) I love the genuine and lifelong friendships that are born here that die here that go up in flames here I love the spontaneous combustion of callout posts I love remembering that if I died tomorrow this would be the last thing on my mind, or anyone else's, and I could have spent more time with my dysfunctional family instead of complaining about them on the internet and I could have spent more time fostering what friendsihps I have instead of psychoanalyzing why I wasn't and I would be annoyed if I'd left so many things unfinished but nothing ever will be and I love feeling fucking *anything* that leaves me looking like an irrational crazy person who's oversensitive and afraid of everything and spilling too many words on this crazy stupid internet for no apparent goddamn reason.

You're all lovely, lovely, flawed animals of people. You terrify me; you baffle me. I love you.
