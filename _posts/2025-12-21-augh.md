<i>[gripping the arm of a chair]</i> I will not succumb to FOMO[<sup>(?)</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) I do not need to join Spotify to see what esoteric little tunes I have been listening to throughout the year I do not need to log, nor to *have* logged, every little thing I do throughout the year in general despite the odd and inexplicable compulsion to do so, possibly borne from journaling habits of youth and/or my archivist tendencies and/or something something existential miasma, the last of which likes to lurk about at the end of each and every year simply because it can.

It's almost 2026.  
<big>**Have you done *enough*?**</big>

## year of @a-flyleaf <small>(@-flyleaf?)</small>, \#wrapt
<div id="wrapt" markdown="1">
- wrote **some untold fuckload of words** between personal docs, playing and chatting with friends, and various little creative whims in between that caught my attention
- played piano **sporadically**, mostly towards the beginning of the year while transcribing [Autoheart's "Agoraphobia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdzufTDfg-o)---an endeavor which is Basically Done except for the fact I wanted to ~put it aside for a while & revisit with fresh eyes for polish~ and have not actually done that.
- pushed **142 [GitHub commits](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/)**, not including this one. Also not including a handful of pages and minisites that either exist solely on my machine or got tossed directly to Neocities. Random niche (private) scraps.
- moved & re-sorted **an unholy number** of books for the job, which is as of writing (and will continue to be moving forward, indefinitely) of a state that would've been mostly-unrecognizable to me earlier in the year. Mildly surreal thought, that!
- drew **less than usual** but **more than last year, probably**, bearing in mind that my benchmark for "usual" is still like... pre-2023, when I had enough to fill giant canvases of [monthly roundups](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery/81345929/compilation-stuff). Mentally I refuse to acknowledge that this has not been the norm for at *least* a couple years now, depsite both drifting hobbies and changing time-availability meaning I am objectively drawing less. *Boo....*
- revisited **at least** ~~3~~ ***4*** old favorite albums/artists, including but not limited to:
	- [Aphex Twin's <i>Drukqs</i>](https://aphextwin.bandcamp.com/album/drukqs),
	- an indie person who I knew on tumblr many many many years ago & have not stayed in touch with but they sent me the files of their music and I still like it a lot (are you even still out there? everything under that name is an ancient dead end, if existent at all),
	- and (in the background as I write) [Halsey's <i>Badlands</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_(Halsey_album)).
	- Oh, and Caravan&nbsp;Palace! I like most of their discography except the odd remix that I don't. [Full playlist (with some other electroswing outliers) here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9X1e0YHMc4kHth1aYACRyMXbVeoAanF-), for your listening delight.
- got ???into?? professional wrestling, something about which I knew **basically nothing** going in except for [this half-hour video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQCPj-bGYro). Have since watched **4** pay-per-view events and counting. I think I understand why gladiators were a thing, now. The whole thing is sociologically fascinating to me on multiple levels but it's also just really swell to see people beat each other up live, for sport for drama for the thrill of it all, in the modern era.
- got *back* into pixel dog micromanagement game [Wolvden](https://www.wolvden.com/), mostly as a way to fill idle minutes and writerly gaps; have now been playing for **about 57** non-consecutive days. Unsure how long this stint will last but it's been a chill time.
- things **watched** include but are not limited to, in no particular order:
	- [<i>Flow</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(2024_film)); 10/10 very good, neat [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM0PL0nQRQU), masterclass in storytelling without dialogue. Feels both timeless (no dialogue, no humans, not at all *without* a sense of place but what's there is somewhat mystical) and fresh (animation Good!!), very nice watch.
	- [the <i>Knights of Guinevere</i> pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCAdbUaMlAE)---which, listen, I probably won't touch it again until and unless the full show releases, but it is *bleeding* influence from <i>Utena</i> and Satoshi&nbsp;Kon (particularly <i>Paranoia Agent</i>) and I am extremely here for that. Placing bets now for a disastrous lesbian breakup but maybe there'll be a [heel-face turn](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn) about it. (Hey, that's wrestling slang!)
	- the <i>Silent Hill 3</i> remake, which was extremely fun to watch & hear the streamer yell about. The final note and the different ways it's contextualized based on the endings is incredibly haunting.
	- <i>Arcane</i>, as [previously mentioned](2025-updates), and which I continue to be regular about
	- <i>K-Pop Demon Hunters</i>, a film which is pretty fun and did not stick in my head the way it seems to have with a non-small portion of the internet (and The Populace At Large apparently) but I'm glad it's taken off the way it has. I'm still stunned that they dropped [the whole fuckign artbook](https://theartofkpopdemonhunters.com/) online, need to look through it, and am #manifesting this energy for basically every other creative project ever. *Give! me! the Process!!!*
- scrolled past **frankly too many** anti-generative-art screeds that would not be out of place in some anti-[Dada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada) and/or "but (photography/digital art/insert new technique du jour) isn't Real Art™!!" snobbery. I, too, am struck with some flavor of "oh god what are we *doing*”-type malaise when I see, like, misshapen claws on a self-published chapter book cover, but also every time I see people lauding the ~inherent humanity~ of art or whatever I'm just like... we're doing this? We're doing this, now?? This is the hill we're dying on, art is good becuse of some transient nigh-spiritual quality only possible to be imbued by The Soul Of Humanity and not, idk, because people making things is good and fun and an activity does not need objective value by any benchmark to be worth doing?? <i>aughhhhh</i> okay ok I'm done. Please focus on the insane energy wasteland that this stuff is allowed to feed and stop giving me "but it's *[degenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art)*" hives. Thank you. I hook myself at the waist with a cane and drag myself comedically off the bullet-note soapbox.
- forgot that this was supposed to be a cheesy fun manual statcounter list **at least once**. Look, I don't draft and review these posts. If I did I simply would not post, ever. It gets #writ✏️ it gets #posted📌 I spot #500errors❌❌❌🙁 post-push and fix it #SeveralMonthsLater⏳ that's just how we do. I have to assume that if you're still reading this textwall behemoth, this amuses you somehow.
</div>
Okay. I'm tired of numbers.

## 2026: *Will* You Do Enough
**This is not a to-do list**. It is just like, stuff I am gesturing in the vague direction of Would Like To Do. No promises no gods no masters etc.

- back up the computer, update to Windows&nbsp;11 (reluctantly, but it'll keep some necessary programs working), maybe dual-boot Linux or dust off that ancient laptop that's already been partially configured with Linux and convert the fucker to Linux 100%. [Linux.](https://linuxcommand.org/) I would like a local machine that stops intermittently trying to install shit I don't need, thank you.
	- <small>(well ok the <b>backup+upgrade</b> part of this *is* a To-Do Item. the linux is  the part that's ???optional/whenever.)</small>
- <b>site things</b>: publish the <i>TFE</i> site; old art backup in some way/shape/form (deviantArt mirror? oth?er?? thign????); I really would like to get [the <i>Ygbtdm</i> colorscript]({{site.url}}/ygbtdm/story/colorscript/) up somehow even if I don't caption everything. All else is ???????
	- <small>also extremely tempted to start toying with the next potential [project]({{site.url}}/projects) idea Directly On-Site, even if it's not published for a while. ---oh god I forgot the projects page hasn't been updated since 2023 help</small>
- I am developing some kind of morbid fascination with <b>real-person-media fanbases</b>, e.g. celebrity culture, wrestling and kayfabe, K-pop... wonder why :V  
&emsp;It doesn't have the same draw to me, personally, the way fully-fictional media does; I'm interested in interrogating that disconnect, because the discrepancies on the fan-level don't seem... necessaaaaarily that different? The binoculars are out. I am not touching the wildlife in its natural habitat. Saying this feels roughly akin to watching videos of tourists in Alaska going "wow, a bear!" while the lumbering creature with very real potential to run up and maul them alive is, like, less than 5&nbsp;ft. away.
- For both character design and general interest reasons I really need to learn how <b>fashion</b> works. This is, I think, my personal equivalent of "tomboys" rejecting <span style="color:#ff00ff;">pink</span>, transing their genders, then reapproaching <span style="color:#ff00ff;">the color</span> with cautious optimism now that it is no longer forced upon them as a Mandatory Interest. *look I can't bitch about outfit design forever it is kind of a fundamental part of designing human beings as a clothes-wearing species---*
- Had the fleeting thought of my “““resolution””” this year being to <b>try one (1) new thing a month</b>. Intentionally very vague. Could be watching or reading (or playing, etc. etc.) the beginning of something I've been meaning to check out, could be a never-before-considered activity. Will it be written about or otherwise publicized in any way? Who knows! But it's A Thought™.

## TL;DR
- did some things
- would like to do more things
- has been year ! 👍

Here's to next \o/
