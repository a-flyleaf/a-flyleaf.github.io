stray thoughts

dA recently had a small explosion over AI stuff, it's a lot of frustration blowup and that thread on thresholds is good. anyway I'm staying but that's another good kick to save my shit

keep entertaining idle thoughts of a code tutorial of some sort, since then I can actually Direct People To Something whilst shilling the benefits of DIY'ing a site

grudge against carrd ended today after reading the creator's twitter for a while & his page on how he made it. it's not his fault the kids are feral and have <abbr title="do not interact">DNIs</abbr> that, if printed, would unfurl comically likea toilet paper scroll and make trees cry. anyway carrds are apparently basically static sites which is surprisingly very cool

thinking maybe it would be nice/good/interesting/etc. to treat storybuilding more like programming---ship early, ship often, get feedback, keep iterating, the job is never truly done etc. well that last part's a misnomer, it's gotta stop *somewhere*, but if nothing else I could probably stand to distance myself from the mythic ideal of The Perfect Finished Product spawning impeccably from the creator's forehead. (gold star if you get the mythology reference)

sometimes when I'm writing primarily for myself I'm like twice as excitable/unhinged as I am when actually talking to people, sometimes (like this post) it's a lot more subdued. duality of man or whatever. I am very conscious (probably *too* conscious) of how typing styles can be the internet's equivalent of audio tone and body language, which makes the current lowkeyness sound kinda dry/dull, but it's also relaxing idek

anyway I don't welcome the AI overlords but they're already here and I'm simultaneously really tired of the fearmonger-y "it's stealing all our hard work" and yet not motivated enough to research thoroughly to write up a thorough debunking. it's cool, I made a "The angel of death corgi" last night on NightCafe which turned out hilarious, I already made a big ramblepost about this so "aggressively ambivalent" (emphasis on the *ambivalent*) is still the best way I can describe my thoughts on it.

it's weird (read: not weird at all) that I can just spitball this easily and be like "yeah publish that" with blog posts, an output to which I ascribe little self-imposed standard or embodiment of talent/self-worth, as opposed to stories and art and such.

it's dark at 6:30pm and it feels like I should be going to bed soon. unsure whether to fight the circadian rhythm with continued blasting of high-powered screen light into my retinas or succumb (I did not sleep until like 2am last night on account of self-control writhing in the face of catsite), though in all realistic honesty I would simply lie down, stare at the ceiling, be haunted/annoyed by TV noise, check my iPad "just real quick," and then we are back at square one.

time, man. what is it.
