I first drafted this post at the end of January, realized I didn't actually have much of substance to share, shoved it in drafts, and now it's a month later and there are actually updates. Cool!<!--more-->

----

## the draft from January 27, more or less
<div id="draft" class="code" markdown="1">
We're closer to 2040 than we are 1940. And that's enough quietly unsettling factoids for one day!

----

I am committing to nothing formal, but it's nearing the end of the month, and I have things to share. Juuuust enough of a handful to "warrant" a new post about it.

- <i>League of Legends</i> show Good‚Ñ¢. Am normal about it.
- 

<br>

<br>

Anyway.

### earworms of the month
- ["Ghost" by Badflower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvoOy9PgBIA), a song with in-your-face "I want to kill myself and here's why and how" lyrics that made me double take when it came up at random in a relative's daily Spotify recommendation playlist<span class="em">---</span>which sounds more concerning than it is, frankly. It was jarring in a "you only listen to old country music, what's this random hyperpop track?" sort of way, not a "holy shit I am concerned for your person" way, for the record. Anyway, it got stuck in my head!
- "[The Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOfFWiVMUXs)" and its [spectacular live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdyY7MCcaHg) by Twenty&nbsp;One Pilots, for the <i>Arcane</i> soundtrack. I've been told the context is extremely sad. I did not go out of my way to listen to a soundtrack song that I don't have context for yet, but 21p has some good stuff and I got curious. I hope when I get to whatever scene this song plays during, it kills me dead just as hard as listening to the song on its own does.
	- [3/01 update: yeah it killed me dead.]
- ["Sucker" by Marcus King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sekyV_o2pM), also from the <i>Arcane</i> soundtrack. And ["Dynasties & Dystopia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fB0IMbq54), ft. various artists, also from<span class="em">---</span>guess what<span class="em">---</span>the <i>Arcane</i> soundtrack. And that [song from <i>Arcane</i>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFVM4QE1qBA) that goes ["AAAAAHAAYAAAAAAAHAHAHEEHOHAAAAA"](https://old.reddit.com/r/arcane/comments/1hru4we/song_from_arcane_that_goes/). As songs do.
- [jaunty instrumental tunes in a language I can't read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZWGa0aQRiY). palette cleanser. as a treat.

### site things
- <b>a-flyleaf.github.io</b>: extremely minor copyediting to [last post](2025-audit)

<i id="cmt">[...I thought there'd be more but then I actually re-checked the repos and there <em class="caps">ain't</em>. okay. cool. whatever I'll publish this next round of Substantial Changes ig]</i>
</div>

## And Then It Was March.
Cool shit discovery link: the animations and music of [Tomasz Wo≈∫niakowski](https://www.youtube.com/@wozniakowski1217), found through [mildly unsettling chairs](https://old.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1ip25ll/the_duality_of_chair/), [a surreal walk](https://old.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1imymjr/equirectangular_walk/), and then just [the entire rest of the audiovisual output](https://www.youtube.com/@wozniakowski1217). Instant and immediate add to my All Time Favorite Video Artists playlist, because [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnxxRRJnGG0) [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcpOtREiLzc) [fuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvrEd7iI0yI).

### site things, more than one (1) bullet edition
In alphabetical order by repository:
<div id="site" markdown="1">
- <b>a-flyleaf</b> <i>[you are here]</i>: did the font-moving thing! updated old pages here & on sub-sites accordingly.
- <b>[/deviantart]({{site.url}}/deviantart)</b>: got possessed by [data entry](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/status-update/We-are-one-1-process-shortening-1157591771) goblins (#2\*)
- <b>[/dragonotes]({{site.url}}/dragonotes)</b>:
	- deprecated old codetest page in favor of datacheck #1\*,  
    +and then used it for *all* the site's data and not just the [dragons](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/dragonotes/dragons/)
	- art is data now too yay, gallery TBA whenever maybe
- <b>[/toyshelf]({{site.url}}/toyshelf)</b>:
	- drafted up a fancy custom character page, which is theoretically why I made the site in the first place
	- revisited & reconfigured various "newhell" pages, for a small collection of concepts that (as of writing) haven't gone anywhere
	- art/datacheck page (#3)\*
	- added art that's been posted up to present. ignore that late 2023 onwards is still almost entirely backlogged,,
- <b>[/ygbtdm]({{site.url}}/ygbtdm)</b>: fixed one (1) broken image link
</div>

### \*what's a "datacheck"
"Flight&nbsp;Rising is dragon neopets" correct but also *wrong*, Flight&nbsp;Rising is [spreadsheets with a game attached](https://arcanistslittlehelper.tumblr.com/post/753258175516606464/wait-no-poll-cancelled-this-is-the-right-answer). Gradually over the years I've taken several levels in spreadsheet management, design, formula-conjuring etc., simply through playing the dragon game a lot and having a shitton of stuff I want to keep track of.

The [DWRP stint](fine-great#dwrp), incidentally, taught me a lot *more* about both sheet-finagling *and* managing Jekyll site data.

It recently occurred to me that fusion is an excellent tactic to make automated data management stronger. Visuals is nice.

So now I have three (and counting, most likely) /datacheck pages which, as the title implies, exist as a quick and easy way for me to check what's going on in the data folders of various sites. (---Actually, hell, I have *four* if we include that yet-to-be-published [<i>TFE</i>]({{site.url}}/projects/tfe) site.) As they exist more for my own reference than the general public's, I expect the links to change and move around a lot indefinitely.

Here are some archived versions, anyway.
<small>(Images are intentionally broken, mind. *good lord the lag*)</small>

1. [pixel lizard hell](https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://a-flyleaf.github.io/dragonotes/codetests/datacheck)
1. [>10 years of internet presentation evolution](https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://a-flyleaf.github.io/deviantart/datacheck)
1. [and these are *actual* public on-my-site pages, now at a glance](https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://a-flyleaf.github.io/toyshelf/art/datacheck)

#### is this showing off to you
Yes.

#### what even *is* this data
Assign numbers and other attributes in one big go, easy to refer to later, no need to retype "Dragon McGee is a dude with black claws and raven hair" 500 times on 500 different pages.

Jekyll is also a neat sitebuilder and if, for instance, I want to *make* 500 different pages, or 500 different sections on a page, I can just type 500 chunks of data one (1) time, and not have to code each instance from the ground up.

#### did... did you *not* do this all along?
[no](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/a-flyleaf.github.io/commit/6faaddd64821ef32bcd8d9ed7456a791d7f28879) [lmao](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/a-flyleaf.github.io/commit/6faaddd64821ef32bcd8d9ed7456a791d7f28879)

#### TL;DR...?
*spreadsheet as webpage go brr*

## what the flyleaf doin next
or: compiling some stuff I've posted as to-do lists over the years. with ‚ú®data‚ú®

<div class="code" id="data">
<p># tdl = to-do list<br># t,s,n = task,status,note (optional)</p>

todo:<ul>{%for td in page.todo%}<li>
	post: <a href="{{td.post}}">{{td.post}}</a><br>
	site:
		<ul>{%for u in td.site%}<li>
			url: {%unless u.url=="[other]"%}/<a href="{{site.url}}/{{u.url}}">{%else%}<i>{%endunless%}<b>{{u.url}}</b>{%unless u.url=="[other]"%}</a>{%else%}</i>{%endunless%}<br>
			tdl:
				<ul>{%for t in u.tdl%}<li class="{{t.s}}">{%if t.s=="scrap"%}<small>{%endif%}
					t: {%unless t.s=="done"%}<b>{%else%}<s>{%endunless%}{{t.t}}{%unless t.s=="done"%}</b>{%else%}</s>{%endunless%}<br>

				{%if t.s=="scrap"%}</small>{%endif%}</li>{%endfor%}</ul>
		</li>{%endfor%}</ul>
</li>{%endfor%}</ul></div>

So, does this mean the "wip" and "no"-statused things will actually be done next? *Ha. <span class="caps">Hahahahahahaha.</span>*

We'll see ·ïï(&nbsp;·êõ&nbsp;)·ïó
