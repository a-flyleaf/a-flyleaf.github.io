There are two parts to this but I can't be bothered to put it on two separate pages (for now, anyway). The <i>404</i> part is below; [click here for the new project rambling](#now-what).<!--more-->

## 404
Imagination is indefinite. Creativity is a limitless resource, making things is cool, and ideas that build and transform and intermingle and what have you—it’s all super heckin rad, and I love it. The Internet has made this easier than ever, from [remixes of obscure band tunes that turn into animation trends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFNwLpMkAiM) to [avant-garde short films from the 80s being turned into Tik-Tok phenomenons](https://www.frieze.com/article/how-cecelia-condits-video-art-became-viral-curse-teens-tiktok). It’s crazy. I’m here for it. I encourage it.

Theoretically, this is the thesis of <i>404</i>, the story-project-thing currently sitting at [my hello-world repository](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/hello-world/). First conceived as a fanfic simply exploring the post-story ramifications on character development, because I was having trouble swallowing the popular fanon that the characters would simply *get along* with no further complications after everything that had happened, it turned into a sequence over a sequence over a sequence over a sequence—the core of which, really, remained the character interaction.

[Here’s something I drew in October 2019]({{site.url}}/stardust), when I was probably in the middle of some sort of brainfog. It’s not related to <i>404</i>, but it is more or less the tone I imagined it going out on. (The characters being blue- and red-themed is coincidental, "void" and all.)

It doesn’t really have a lot to do with that creative celebration thesis, does it?

Truth is, *that* didn’t kick in until January 2020, when I was introduced to <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1xAzPlh4i0">Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</a></i>. The visuals *enthralled* me. The anime (I haven't read the manga) is a love letter to animation itself, from expansive worlds to individualized characters to the inevitable but necessary aspects of business management. And I thought, y’know, it’d be kinda cool if <i>404</i> explored similar territory, but for the web.

Websites are inherently fluid. Put social media aside for a minute and consider the Old Web™, when people hacked HTML and CSS together from scratch on Geocities and other hosts (an era before my time, but definitely one I admire <a href="https://neocities.org/browse?tag=retro">in spirit</a>). Why should exploring a site be linear as an infinitely-scrolling feed when there are *links*? Sometimes those links are *hidden*! Sometimes even the URLs are interesting! Even on a mainstream level, the Wikipedia rabbit hole is enough of a phenomenon to, apparently, warrant [its own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_rabbit_hole). It stands to reason that a web“comic” would be the *perfect* medium to explore an idea like this.

As it happened, I’d already planned on having hidden pages and file bonuses for 404; its fanfic-era source material, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club!"><i>Doki Doki Literature Club!</i></a>, hinged much of its “horror” on the player’s familiarity with computer mechanics, from surprise pictures to deleted folders as the game progressed (and, through in-game prompts, encouraged such file exploration). While I can’t exactly grab someone’s computer username from a website (or without prompting them to enter it first, which defeats the surprise), I can use similar ideas to inform my… storytelling?

But here’s the thing.

The core aspect of <i>DDLC</i> that interested me was the idea of meta-narrative awareness: one character is aware she’s trapped in a game, specifically one with a predictable ending which goes poorly for her. However, there are never any direct allusions to the game’s real-world creator(s); there’s abstract talk of scripts and code, but the actual author remains a non-person. Which is good, far as this self-contained gimmick is concerned; it keeps the audience’s attention away from thinking of giant AI conspiracy theories (while they’re playing, anyway), and directly on the shock and horror of what’s happening in what previously presented itself in a cute, innocent game.

The shock value was of little interest to me in <i>404</i>; right from the start, after all, the core game was a backstory, the foundation of fan-fiction. Again, I was more interested in the ramifications on the characters. It made sense to continue drawing as little attention to the actual real-world author(s) as possible, even once all characters had attained “meta-awareness.” No one’s here for the Flyleaf behind the curtain, and even though the site would inevitably be hosted on my (GitHub-based) domain, I wanted to keep other traces of myself minimal. I even went far as making a separate email address, and uploading very little <i>404</i>-related art to other platforms, to maintain some illusion of an authorless story.

This, along with what I had planned, necessitated the characters also not realizing they were in a website. There is one section in which the characters explicitly address a hypothetical reader, the “about” pages, because their in-story archive of the entire game had just been wiped and they wanted some trace of their existence… in existence. Something like that. Honestly, I just had to revisit my own page to double-check. It was *that* insignificant of a footnote, for something that essentially starts the story. (Hey, doesn’t “starts the story” sound kind of linear?)

There are two “thesis statements” at play in the long-term trajectory for <i>404</i> (which, frankly, is incomplete; I have a rough idea of three installments after “debug,” loose ideas for four more after, and then it’s all blended together to memory). The first is the championing of creativity—something of an afterthought, but one that’s not wholly *in*compatible with what the story was. Besides, fun as I find them, I don’t want the story to be *quite* as surreal and ungrounded as, say, [the *ENA* series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhPaJURyApsoMQDaoft5t0l0iAwUOLtlM) or (what used to be) [the Goodbye Strangers project](https://web.archive.org/web/20210324034654/https://strangers.atrocityland.com/); there’s still a core cast, and they have their linear histories and hang-ups. (By the way, I should note that I didn’t find either of these until well after <i>404</i> had faded from my creative foreground, though I immediately thought they’d both be A+ inspirations for a hypothetical reboot/rewrite/revamp/whatever; more on this later.) In the end (and note, again, the linear implications of an *end*), the characters accept that, not only do they *have* to build their world, that this isn’t a burden but a *blessing*, and it is <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">high</em> time they had fun with it.

The second thesis is that life is kind of weird and pointless no matter what you do, which is about as dismal or inspiring as you make it; sue me, I like [optimistic nihilism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14). At any rate it’s not only necessary but healthy for certain characters to accept that there are things they cannot control, including and especially their world (you can write a beautiful program, but can you *guarantee* it’ll work?) and the people around them (trying to manage people like assets is a one-way road to disaster).

These theses get along about as well as Rudy and Kade. When they’re actively working together, it’s less out of collaboration and more because one has ceded to the other’s will; “debug” would have concluded with Kade finally deciding to worldbuild with Rudy, and all is well. (And then they get stuck in the block dimension. <!--Then they have to build a literal bridge back through the void, while the figurative (already extremely tenuous, more like a tightrope than a) bridge between Val and Cyrus goes up in flames, so by the time the siblings get back she’s tried to remove herself from the picture again. Then by the time the others find her, she’s managed to create four “bots” in their own images, which she expects will do all the tedious worldbuilding work & management so none of them will ever have to work another day on anything in their entire lives. Then, inevitably, the bots decide to fuck around with free will, and meanwhile (intra)personal crises on the base fours’ behalves are had. Then I lose track of the story.--> But I digress.)

I dunno, man. They totally *could* work together, as could any two ideas. But frankly, webcomics is hard, and I can’t explain how long this has been dragged out in any way except that my creative focus has latched onto something else. I think, for my own piece of mind, it’s time to call this An Attempt, and stop letting it haunt me.

Well, kind of.

I’m still totally down to revisit the idea, incorporating what’s already there or tossing/retconning it entirely. Unlike [<i>The Firebird Effect</i>]({{site.url}}/projects/tfe), which I straight-up lost interest in when I tired of untangling all its eventual plot threads and tonal inconsistencies, I would definitely *not* say I’ve lost interest in <i>404</i>. Those pixel people are still very near and dear to my (not-card-suit-shaped-)heart, and I hardly feel done playing with their world. What this means for “the story” remains unclear.

In any case, the author is still very much dead, so to speak. I’m not going to be having conversations with the characters any time soon, even if it *did* start out as a big indulgent fanfic. (You know, like people used to do in author’s notes. #OnlyRealFFDotNetNerdsUnderstand.) What I *am* thinking is that I just say to hell with the linear narrative, update whatever whenever, and see where it takes me.

Takes *them*? Whatever; to hell with only updating on 4/04s and 8/08s, at any rate. That was *only* sustainable if I actually had substantial updates to provide on those dates, which has evidently not exactly gone according to keikaku. <!--Plus, you see that one fix on 7/15? That was supposed to be on 7/14, not because either of those numbers are story-relevant but because I just liked the look of them—except by the time I’d finished troubleshooting and pushed the commit, it was past midnight. (edit: Incidentally, that also happened to this blog post!) Alas, even in its “purest” state, 404 is not immune to real-life Shenanigans of “God.”-->

Where will it go from here? ~We’ll see~

## now what
Anyway, about that shifting creative focus, and on webcomics in general.

You know, it totally doesn’t fit the story at all (there is no meta-narrative, no parade of creativity; it is *allllll* in on the personal drama, babey), but the idea I’ve been toying with for the past year has accidentally kind of embodied all those concepts of play and development. The idea first spawned in November 2020, as one of a couple little story-starters I entertained for like a day and then moved past—and then around January, in typing up those notes for personal archival, I thought, <i>this idea kinda slaps tho ngl.</i>

So the two characters at the crux got designs. New characters spawned to mirror them. And, while I am normally reluctant to publicize anything story-related because ~spoilers~ or whatever, I didn’t care about that this round because I wasn’t thinking it was going to become A Thing™. Figured I’d just play around with the idea some more, inevitably lose interest, fun was had call it a day.

Well, it’s December 2021, and I’ve told a non-small amount of people about the story, all with the assumption it would, in fact, become A Thing™. So, I guess now it’s going to become A Thing?? While there are still some significant details being sorted out, I actually know how it *ends*, which hasn’t happened with previous projects. It’s nice to actually be writing towards an end goal, even if said goal has shifted over time and isn’t 100% clear yet. And I am *very* much still posting “concept art” and other character sketches; certain especially-damning spoilers have been withdrawn, but besides that I am not being judicious for shit. You can *see* that I’ve been struggling with a certain character’s design for months now (only recently landed on something I think could stick), for reasons that I haven’t made clear but could be *much* more suspicious in context. Hell, you can even kinda tell that what’s now a fairly significant aspect, a certain recurring monster, wasn’t even a *thing* (visually, anyway) until I was designing a random character’s shirt, slapped a logo on it, and the resulting design kinda reminded me of an animal.

But I have reached an impasse.

Webcomics, again, Is Hard. By and large, one person does *literally everything*. (*Sometimes* they have help and/or collaborators, but that ain't the norm.) It’s definitely not impossible to finish, but there’s a reason so many end in either “indefinite hiatus” hell (yes I am poking myself here with that) or straight-up cancellation. Time is inevitable; personally, I know I can’t be assed to keep up on stories that update at one (1) page a week unless I’m actively “consuming” it (in conversation with the author, and/or participating in fandom) to keep track of things, and would much rather read in distinct chunks.

Which is more or less how I imagine the ideal audience-engagement schedule, for this story. I keep joking in my notes about it being an anime; a full episode a week, spanning just a season, would be a *swell* timeframe for release. Hopefully/ideally it has good “rewatch value,” but at the end of the day, it’s this hammy little narrative that got away from me. I want people to engage it as a sum of its parts, not at the agonizing drip of one page a $wheneverRateIsReasonablySustainable; that pace makes it *impossible* to engage an entire story. It’s like reading a novel, except you can only read one paragraph a month. Or watching a movie one minute a week.

To be clear, I totally get why it’s a thing. It’s a compromise between actually putting things out more than once in a blue moon vs the personal reality of making that many pages. Average internet artist is not a mangaka. (Who, by the by, are often overworked to hell anyway.) I simply, as a reader, do not vibe with it, and so it’s not something I’d want to use as a creator—especially not, for aforementioned reasons, for this story.

So What Do.

I still… do not quite *know*, for sure. I *want* a good chunk of it, or at the very least the pivotal moments, to be shown in full comic form; while it’s not as experimental with the medium as <i>404</i> is with the webpage, there are some aspects I’ve only considered conveying via comic layout. Certain visual motifs are *extremely* important, and I think they’d get lost in translation in prose. As it is, I’m trying to summarize everything for beta-reading’s sake, and I am having a *hell* of a time striking a balance between detail I think is necessary and, y’know, the compactness of a summary.

I think about meta and mediums a lot.

But in any case, I’m tying this into the <i>404</i> sendoff because… idek, I felt like it. I’m wondering if, instead of dedicating myself to a full-ass comic start to finish, I could use some (modified, expanded) version of the “summary,” interspersed gratuitously with doodles, concepts, and actual comic segments—and continually update as needed, both to add new scribbles *and* even make story changes as I deem necessary. Hell, I could even try sketching out an entire “episode” in one go, use *that* for a less-collaged version of the story, and update those pages if and as they’re finished?

Essentially, it’d be the kind of thing that, in retrospect, I could’ve done with <i>404</i> from the getgo. Does it fit or have anything to do with the story? Heck no! But is it getting the idea Out There, committing to [Finished Not Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRtV-ugIT0k), all that jazz—so if my interest happens to wander before finishing A Whole-Ass Comic, I can still look back and say I have a body of work that tells a complete story, even if it’s not *quite* the story I initially envisioned it being?

Maybe.

—a-flyleaf; December 22, 2021. Oh yeah, signatures are necessary for blog posts. It just felt right, man.

P.S. My attitude towards spoilers, which is by and large “I don’t care, and in fact spoilers have often been the thing to get me *into* a piece of media I wouldn’t have otherwise looked twice at,” is probably an influence here.

P.P.S. If, having posted all this, I don’t have *anything* to show for this new idea by 2023 except out-of-context drawings and sketches, future!me will probably be disappointed. [Fail faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDjrOaoHz9s), dangit!!

P.P.P.S. Oh god, I really need a new blog post layout. But, y’know, see above.
