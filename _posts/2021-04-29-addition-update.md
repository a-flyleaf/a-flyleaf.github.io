So [this is a thing now](/shriblets/2021-04-29-split). Additional context:<!--more-->

This semster we dabbled in [net.art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net.art), which was eye-opening as heck, and one of the pieces used as an example was <i>[My Boyfriend Came Back from the War](https://anthology.rhizome.org/my-boyfriend-came-back-from-the-war)</i>. Was intrigued on sight because *that is such a cool way to convey a split narrative,* and despite the frame HTML having been phased out years ago, it still functions like new.

Unrelated to that, I've been wanting to do *something* with some of the old characters I've had lying around collecting virtual dust for years, and today I realized a couple dysfunctional dynamics were the *perfect* candidates for some narrative parallel shenanigans. Thus the shriblet (linked above) happened.

On one hand I don't have any plans to Do Anything with that set of characters any time soon; on the other, I'm just gonna take that as a cue to use them as guinea pigs for random little storytelling experiments like this. Like a beta preview or concept art, for something that may or may not ever be released via One True Canonical Version.

Am I a professional yet?
