I have a frankly ridiculous amount of random little pages floating around<!--more--> [glitch.me](http://a-flyleaf.glitch.me/shriblets/) and buried on my hard drive, so tonight I decided to consolidate those onto a new "shriblets" directory. The link to that little art showcase from last year has broken twice now, woohoo.

This, kids, is why you use a sitemap with everything you want on the site *before* you actually code the thing. However, I've been winging this site from day one, and I will not be stopped.
