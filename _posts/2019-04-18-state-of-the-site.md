There’s a certain thrill to hand-coding a website like this.<!--more--> Gone is the uncontrollable code of a bloated CMS. Farewell, text fields forbidding HTML. Hello, simple, quickly-loading static pages, in which everything appears exactly as I want it to! It’s all I need from a site for the foreseeable future.

As for what those website needs *are*, exactly, here’s the current plan:

- An About and Contact page seem like a good bare minimum. Said pages exist and have approximately nothing on them. This will change eventually.

- Portfolio of my visual work, from academic projects to personal pursuits. This may require a CMS because I have a *lot* of images and would like to code them [responsively](//www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp), but do not particularly look forward to resizing everything manually.

- Right now the blog has a whole two entries, an [initial test post](/blog/here-goes-nothin) and this one, but sooner or later I’ll need to figure out categories, tags, featured images, pagination, RSS, all that jazz. [Staticman](//staticman.net) looks like a good option for comments if for whatever reason I *want* comments.

I have no idea how professionally I want to present myself here, but the tone of this post seems about right. In any case, one thing is certain: I would like to *never touch any social media ever again thank you and good bye*

edit 4/21: It is also worth noting that doing everything by hand means, if something goes horrifically wrong, I have only myself to blame.

I made several significant edits on the 18th, when this post was written, but none of them went live. The error message, humbled by the sheer volume of changes in the single commit (I might be using Git wrong), was vague and unhepful. Thus I force-reset to the last live commit. Minor update by update, the perpetrator finally made itself clear: incorrect blog date formatting.

And it only took three days and an absolute mess of teeny tiny edits! The master branch commit history is a disaster. It was even more of a wreck before the forced reversion. Having said that, now that everything finally works as it should, future commits should be less haphazard.

It’s a learning experience.
