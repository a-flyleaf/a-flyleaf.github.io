There’s a certain thrill to hand-coding a website like this.<!--more--> Gone is the uncontrollable code of a bloated CMS. Farewell, text fields forbidding HTML. Hello, simple, quickly-loading static pages, in which everything appears exactly as I want it to! It’s all I need from a site for the foreseeable future.

As for what those website needs *are*, exactly, here’s the current plan:

- An About and Contact page seem like a good bare minimum. Said pages exist and have approximately nothing on them. This will change eventually.

- Portfolio of my visual work, from academic projects to personal pursuits. This may require a CMS because I have a *lot* of images and would like to code them [responsively](//www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp), but do not particularly look forward to resizing everything manually.

- Right now the blog has a whole two entries, an [initial test post](/blog/here-goes-nothin) and this one, but sooner or later I’ll need to figure out categories, tags, featured images, pagination, RSS, all that jazz. [Staticman](//staticman.net) looks like a good option for comments if for whatever reason I *want* comments.

I have no idea how professionally I want to present myself here, but the tone of this post seems about right. In any case, one thing is certain: I would like to *never touch any social media ever again thank you and good bye*
