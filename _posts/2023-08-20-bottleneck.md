welcome to the uncorkening, motherfuckers

> Not gonna lie, there's a part of me that thinks [making an entire fansite for a game I *just* played at the time of writing] is a little excessive/hasty; I mean, I've had other All-Consuming Hyperfixations and they haven't gotten their own websites, and I'm barely over a full 30 days into this one. Who's to say the interest won't drop off, like, as soon as I finish reviewing the playthrough if not before then? I *severely* doubt that, but it's a possibility! What if what if what if [insert more anxiety brain scrargling here] ("scrargling" is not a word but it is the closest approximation to the sound I'm imagining)

[narrator voice] It Has Been Over Half a Year and The Writer Is Still Into <i style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Omori</i>.

uhh suffice it to say the site of mine that's been getting updated lately is that one, and nigh-*exclusively* that one. Also as of July I have tentatively started using Dreamwidth again, so that's been cool *and* scratches the semi-regular update itch. (it *does* render my blog here a bit redundant, tho.) Also also deviantArt gets worse and worse every time I check it which, combined with most of my art since January having been fanart (meaning I can upload it straight to the site, elsewhere be damned), has made me, uhh, *less than enthusiastic* about keeping dA up-to-date.

idek what I'm doing online anymore let's put it that way.

## but Today:
Site's been long overdue for some updates for a *while* now; I've had a bunch of changes sitting in my local GitHub commits, so today I figured I'd actually start cleaning them up.

<div id="danas" markdown="1">
- In my drafts sits an absolute *behemoth* of a March--July-ish linkdump, which mostly turned into songspam. Might as well publish that at some point, but I've entertained the idea of turning it into like, a sort of yearbook "song most likely to get stuck in my head" sort of thing. That requires Effortâ„¢, though, so we'll see if it happens...?
- After getting roadblocked at redoing the index from scratch, I ultimately decided to keep it very similar to [last version]({{site.url}}/oldpages/index/v1), just with a font update and no links. But since the space between the header and footer looked empty with just the "internet hub" line, I slapped in a "status update" of sorts; currently it's the following, and we'll see if it sticks but for now it remains *very, very true*:

> <small><b>2023/08/20</b>:</small> deep in <a href="{{site.url}}/omori"><i style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal;">Omori</i> hell</a> for 8&nbsp;months and counting but at least the main site finally got an updateâ€¦!!

If nothing else, maybe having a *small* ephemeral thing on the homepage will make me more likely to keep it up-to-date, instead of feeling like I gotta overhaul the whole thing every time...?

- The [about]({{site.url}}/about) is now *significantly* less TL;DR than [before]({{site.url}}/oldpages/about/v1), which idk how to feel about yet but I like that the design matches the homepage now. Considered putting the text on the left to make it look like a flipped business card (that's what the original design is based on) but thought it was kinda disorienting, plus I coded it weird so the scrollbar would be in the wrong place unless I redid it from scratch >:V
</div>

I am extremely on the fence about whether to (re-)incorporate the scribble background on pages like this.... I coded it out for a reason on those interim blog posts, because even if it's Peak Minimalism Hell, I *do* like the cleaner look, dangit. But I don't *not* miss the splash of color.... ðŸ¤”

*Eh,* something to futz over later. That and the projects page. And the shriblets, I miiight turn that into a repo and also figure out a way to link random pages I've accumulated in not-main-site folders for code testing, bcause they *do* exist and are kinda just buried wherever and I Must Document Everything. *And* the ["miscellaneous things I want to do at some point" from January](eleven#miscellaneous-things-i-want-to-do-at-some-point) still moooostly stands, and so basically, \*explodes\*

---actually fuck it new to-do list while I'm here:
- main site (you are here):
	- ~~new homepage + plaintext layout~~
	- do Something about that giant unholy not-March post
	- offshoot <i>TFE</i> repo? mostly to separate pages, have the character writeups together more coherently, maybe drop some retrospective commentary
	- maaaybe reincorporate scribbl-bg into plaintext? or make it an Option
- <i>[You're gonna be the death of me]({{site.url}}/ygbtdm)</i>:
	- finish uploading the rest of the colorscript
	- designnote spoiler pages
	- revamp main story & cast indexes
	- publish a complete outline, keep winging it from there
- [whatever the fansite's called]({{site.url}}/omori): there's a whole "TBA" file/page for this lmao. [Toyshelf]({{site.url}}/toyshelf) has one too, now...!
	- but for the record, ~~"disaster crew" links-thing"~~ did indeed get done, and I'm totally not rewriting it just because I gave myself a fancy check CSS style and want to use it again. (shit, is it *that* easy to ping my brain's accomplishment detector??) it is a draft and not at all publicized, but it exists now yaayyyyy.
