We're closer to 2040 than we are 1940. And that's enough quietly unsettling factoids for one day!<!--more-->

I am committing to nothing formal, but it's nearing the end of the month, and I have things to share. Juuuust enough of a handful to "warrant" a new post about it.

- Towards the end of last month, I started watching <i>Arcane</i>. As of writing, I am nearly 3/4ths through <i>Arcane</i>. <i>Arcane</i> has a frankly troubling amount of Terminal Brainrot Energy (read: it could very well be the next thing to take over my life), and is spared (thus far) only because its fast-paced ensemble cast storytelling prevents me from properly latching onto any particular character---a common throughline in my past Terminal Brainrot Medias.
- No, seriously. I could make an autobiography out of characters who have wedged their way into my skull, set up camp, and refused to leave for 2--3 years minimum. There is a scrapped sketch in my folders somewhere which spotlights this very thing, as a birthday gift to myself, except then I played <i style="text-transform:uppercase;">Omori</i> and. [well you know](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/changelog).
- Besides my usual egotism, may your takeaway from this be <i>Arcane is really fucking good</i>. It is so ludicrously fucking good I am seriously considering dipping a figurative toe back into social media for the sole purpose of discussing this goddamn motherfucking show *do you understand how absolutely dire it is that my quote-unquote "note to self" personal discord channel is absolutely <em style="text-transform:uppercase;">imploding</em> with links to analyses I've found good lord send help*

Anyway.

## earworms of the month
- ["Ghost" by Badflower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvoOy9PgBIA), a song with in-your-face "I want to kill myself and here's why and how" lyrics that made me double take when it came up at random in a relative's daily Spotify recommendation playlist---which sounds more concerning than it is, frankly. It was jarring in a "you only listen to old country music, what's this random hyperpop track?" sort of way, not a "holy shit I am concerned for your person" way, for the record. Anyway, it got stuck in my head!
- "[The Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOfFWiVMUXs)" and its [spectacular live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdyY7MCcaHg) by Twenty&nbsp;One Pilots, for the <i>Arcane</i> soundtrack. I've been told the context is extremely sad. I did not go out of my way to listen to a soundtrack song that I don't have context for yet, but 21p has some good stuff and I got curious. I hope when I get to whatever scene this song plays during, it kills me dead just as hard as listening to the song on its own does.
- ["Sucker" by Marcus King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sekyV_o2pM), also from the <i>Arcane</i> soundtrack. <i style="text-transform:uppercase;">Get the fuck outta my head / So long, sucker~</i> â™ª
- [jaunty instrumental tunes in a language I can't read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZWGa0aQRiY). palette cleanser. as a treat.
