Wow, it sure has been a year! Awfully quiet around here. But as of today I finally backed up [an old project of mine]({{site.url}}/tfe),<!--more--> and I'm thinking of just using a single landing page for my "portfolio." Keep it simple, silly. Start small, expand as needed, makes for fewer empty placeholders.

We'll see how that goes.
