## vignette (not just the outline)
<div id="sf" markdown="1">
I wanted to sleep in today. Despite being awake at least a couple hours past midnight, minimum, on some accursed autopilot I first saw the clock at about 9AM instead. Blissful return to slumber immediately evaded me on account of the scourge that is allergies, which is frankly sort of bullshit because it's the middle of winter.

Normal weather. Super duper normal weather. Not cause for [concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) at all.

Anyway, after attempting in vain to sleep again, to the screen I locked my eyes. I stumbled across a clip of [unsourced winter shenanigans](https://www.tumblr.com/jabberding0/798437098383376384/winter-shenanigans), which I sent to a friend less familiar with the joys and toils of snow season. The song "[Gabriela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flc76dRcIdQ)" has been on loop in my head since last night; the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjnB56tSCQI) is a delight. There's probably a similar glee in telenovela acting as there is to throwing another human being through a table as there is to chucking a heap of snow off a bridge onto crackling ice several feet below. My main takeaways from the winter video, though, was 1)&nbsp;<i>I should send this to $friendInQuestion</i> and 2)&nbsp;<i>aren't their hands cold?!</i>

----

I had the idea a few days back of doing some kind of Monthly Mini-project; in which, while I am not creatively hooked on anything in particular, I attempt to lasso some portion of my artbrain around a small-scale concept that I work on for the month. For several years now my new-year-malaise thought has centered roughly around the idea <i>I need to be weirder I need to do more strange and interesting shit</i>, and (tragically!) strange and novel shit does not magically float my way upon a cloud.

At one point recently I did a small blogpost reskim of things I've written around this time of year previously, and I do sound a bit like a broken record.

Anyway.

		“fetch.” a dog finds a ball. there are many Many Many Ways this can be pulled off; what dog, what ball. drawn? blender triangle-doge & flat circle?? each panel is Different (does not have to be 31) and then it’s over.
		<br>actually: dog <em>retrieves</em> a ball. looping gif? get the keyframes down first then fill the rest. could end up looking like some felix colgrave shit with clean(ish) motion but wildly different styles. him <i>[sic; in reference to Colgrave]</i>, multi-animator projects where each artist draws a frame (thinking of the arcane redraws but I’ve seen similar elsewhere), that sort of thing</p>
		<p><small>[10:48]</small><br>
		collaged dog. words (lyrics?) in the silhouette of a dog. dog walking by mundane or extremely not mundane backdrops.
		<br>dog made of screenshots of this brainstorming spree</p>
		<p><small>[11:02]</small><br>
		bonus round: for this and other monthly thigns. when the month is over & things are posted <em>I delete it all.</em> like maybe not layers in sketchfiles but the process is posted along the way And Then It’s Gone. this idea mortifies me somewhat but it <em>is</em> An Idea</p>

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is 3D modeling software, but it is capable of 2D and apparently even video-compositing. Since discovering these things about it I have yet to use it for either purpose, but I would like to learn! Have not had the ideas in mind to warrant jumping in the deep end like that. Maybe this would suit?

### back to the present.
There's a book on a table in my room, Max&nbsp;Gladstone's [<i>Three Parts Dead</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Craft_Sequence), which I've read a very small portion of over the past several days. I like what I've read! It's also weirdly difficult to "justify" Sitting Down And Reading for a prolonged period of time, when I *could* be coding or writing or doing a shitton of reading but in the medium social media posts and/or Wikipedia rabbitholes.

There are other snippets in [the draft above](#np), but they speak for themselves I think.

## things done since [last post](augh)
<div class="np" id="things" markdown="1">
things done post-12/21 update
- watched the lennon chess short
- dA post data & timeline
- <https://old.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1ni7z9q/toot_toot/>
- m. more dA uploads..\..
- The Process.png <-\- is why the TFE site's been stalled I think. I was up too late and Gave Up mid-page and haven't revisited it bfdskvnsdkjdsf
- slight colophon update: cloudcanon link broke, added color blender. could overhaul the whole thing tbh
- backed up iPad sketchfiles
- more music: Oliver Buckland. Wimdy. Hypothermic. "toot toot", and by extension of the latter: <span><https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuqXBU6WgaY></span> (VErY felix colgrave, this)
- futzed around in blendec
- drew some thank-you woofs
- wolvden art backup
</div>

My <i>R</i> key has been broken for hell-knows-how-long. I'm gonna ballpark it at about a couple years. Desktop typing that I don't edit for public clarity has looked very normal in the interim.

linkspam time.

<div id="linkspam" markdown="1">
- [lennon chess short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W68-XaFepOg). Charming! Bit odd (not in a bad way) to see Pixar-styled characters doing war violence. I never actually noticed that's what the song lyrics were, so [mission accomplished](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9GGLx3Yom4).
- deviantArt post data → [timeline](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/deviantart/timeline), a frankly kind of unholy endeavor to the apparent benefit of no one except maybe myself. I think maybe I am not going to fucking manually mirror all of that. Just, like, some of it? Bits and pieces.
- [Woźniakowski](https://www.youtube.com/@womasz/videos) makes [extremely cool things](https://old.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1ni7z9q/toot_toot/). Some additional highights in [a previous post](2025-updates#and-then-it-was-march)!
- recent uploads on the art version of myspace: [RP art](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/kibby-1279108555), [random headshot](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/yuwi-mdp-1279111179), [RP art (crosscanon ed.)](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/this-was-SUPPOSED-to-be-a-DOODLE-mdp-1279112523), [old character](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/flaming-avian-1279115599), [bug lizard](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/bugge-1279118440), [old character (slightly redesigned)](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/fear-dot-se-1279119630), [fanart](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/storyboard-redraw-thign-1279121560). By virtue of having linked these on my site they are now entitled to a personal mirror eventually.
- The Process:  
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/blog/the-process.png" alt="Screenshot of Notepad++ (coding program) with a line in which I yell about being tired and finishing the file later. Off to the side is the file explorer, highlighting a date modified time of 01:05(AM).">  
Being able to finish weeks worth of work in one hyperfocused mega-session is pretty cool, right up until it slams up against the physical limitations of the human body.
- patch notes: [colophon]({{site.url}}/colophon) now uses an archived link 
to the [CloudCannon Jekyll date tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20200630074924/https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/date-formatting/); added [hex color blender](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/).
- public results of sketchfile backup & blender futzing ???TBA, maybe, possibly never or mayhaps in 10+ years. The "woofs" and Wolvden art might get itself a page soonish, though, since unlike Flight&nbsp;Rising I don't have like a decade of scattered drawings to sift through.
</div>

+and, last but certainly not least: music recs~
- the entire discography of [Oliver&nbsp;Buckland](https://oliver-buckland.bandcamp.com/); but if you only listen to one, highlight of the season is "[flying](https://oliver-buckland.bandcamp.com/track/flying)"
- [extraordinarily silly douyin](https://rongzhi.tumblr.com/post/686789834253156352/english-added-by-me) → [(cover of) the song that plays in the background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqDTWlZKGug). Tunes to eat comically large glasses of ramen & strut hyper-fashionably down the street to.
- [winter cowboy roadtrip song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEzhpnpAplA)
- that Woźniakowski short ([on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgENnFhniOg) for your looping pleasure), which (according to a [reddit comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1ni7z9q/toot_toot/ng50o5m/)) samples "[Root Grow Emerge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuqXBU6WgaY)." I wrote "Felix&nbsp;Colgrave vibes" but I'm thinking of a tune by a *different* group, which he did the [the music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK41XdAOw3o) for. (Three recs *and* a behind-the-scenes for your buck, this note!)
