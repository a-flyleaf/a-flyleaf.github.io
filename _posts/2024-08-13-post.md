so apparently I have not one but two blog posts sitting in my folder that haven't been published, as of writing, between now and August of last year. cool! that more or less represents where I've been at.

- It's really cool getting into a new hobby like "oh I'm just going to dip my toe in for a month or two, probably flit off eventually like things of this sort tend to go," and then I blink and it's been a whole year and I'm in deeper than anticipated with no sign of stopping.
- This has, as probably written previously, put a teeny (read: Big) stopgap in my other hobbies. Sometimes I'm not sure how to feel about that.
- Saw a dog at work the other day. [Effervescent](https://cockmcstuffins.tumblr.com/post/173037113454/bella-was-lucky-she-didnt-have-a-cell-phone-of).
- Invidious is down as of writing, and Nitter bit the dust several months ago. Deeply unfortunate development.
- On the upswing, it's nice to occasionally delve back into the social media lurking weeds and realize most of its dramas and toils are like... foreign to me, at this point. God, it's good to be free!
