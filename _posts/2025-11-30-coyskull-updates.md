Today's updates are brought to you by a real-life coyote skull. Say hello, real-life coyote skull.<!--more-->

<figure>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/assets/blog/coyskull.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/blog/coyskull.png" alt="photo of the coyote skull, held in one hand"></a>
	<figcaption>“Howdy.”</figcaption>
</figure>

I never spend money on myself and I think as far as vanity purchases go this one is pretty fucking cool. So he's immortalized now. On my blog. Because where else do you put these things.

<div id="qna" markdown="1">
<b>Q</b>: <b class="q">Did you make this page all dark, regardless of the user's browser theme, to better fit the image?</b>  
<b>A</b>: Yes.

<b>Q</b>: <b class="q">Why *is* the image is edited all [chiaroscuro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro) fake-[stippling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stippling) style?</b>  
<b>A</b>: Why would I *not* edit the image all chiaroscuro fake-stippling style?

<b>Q</b>: <b class="q">Are you going to talk about the skull literally at all anywhere else in this post?</b>  
<b>A</b>: No.

## internet immortality is fake, actually.
Did you know widely-used image host imgur is [basically useless for people in the UK now](https://web.archive.org/web/20251008164432/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzxv5gy3qo)? Not-unrelatedly, do you remember seeing forums littered with invalid Photobucket, Tinypic, Imageshack, and other popular image hosting service "This image is not available"-type thumbnails? Anyway.

## The Update Section
- Went through all my sites and purged imgur URLs, switching to onsite files and the occasional [Postimage](https://postimages.org/) reupload. This *mostly* affected old pages on [dragonotes](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/dragonotes/).
	- There are other imgur outlinks buried in the data for that deviantArt mirror site which I may or may not ever get around to constructing. As with many things, that is a bridge to cross if/when I get to it.
- elsewhere: Cleaned up a bunch of backend things while I was at it. Folders are now less disorganized and Jekyll caches are clear. This has no public-facing effect whatsoever. 🎉
- There's a [/collections]({{site.url}}/collections) barely-even-site that I was using back in 2021 to play around with [data](2025-updates#what-even-is-this-data). I think I mentioned it in some old post or art description somewhere? Anyway, it's public now. Nothing super exciting, but [my sense of humor]({{site.url}}/collections/deskclutter) has not changed whatsoever in 4&nbsp;years.

All ↑this was done today. As for older stuff, it's those dragonotes pages:

- I recreated basically my entire character roster as dragons, and coded myself a [bio generator]({{site.url}}/dragonotes/codetests/biomaker) <small>(link liable to break)</small> to keep their onsite info ~consistent. Look, ma, more data!
- The primary subject of the Imgur sweep was [all these ancient crusty pages]({{site.url}}/dragonotes/v0), an archive of the dragon "site" before I had much of a site. I keep everything, you see. Sometimes, an entire decade later, it rises from the depths of my files scrubbed free of since-broken links. Huzzah!
- That's it.

## "Q": <span class="q">You don't know how to conclude this post, do you.</span>
