Months are kind of arbitrary, aren't they? By which I mean these past ~44 days have felt like 2 or 3 "months" in a trenchcoat. The first part felt like a natural flow from the end of 2023, then a game took over my life, and I just finished it last week so I am slowly not having 24/7 Game Thoughts.

It's more like 12/5 (which is a lowball estimate) instead, but I digress.

## January in notes
I made a point to actually jot down stuff I published, among other links and snippets of interest, throughout the month. Faltered once The Game took over my brain, but still, here's a bunch of stuff:

<div class="notes" markdown="1">
### things done (on the internet)
<span class="later">[plus some side notes that ended up here and not later for some reason. <span style="display:inline-block">highlights bolded for ease of skimming]</span></span>

</div>
<div class="footnotes" markdown="1">
<span class="ast" id="piano">\*</span> Random fun fact about yours truly, I play piano and have since I was 11! Never uploaded anything related to it, though; recently I likened it to a friend as painting by numbers, where I know how to read sheet music (can match numbers to colors) but lack the fundamental understanding of theory (anatomy, lighting, etc.) to really get creative with it. I took lessons for a few years, which *did* include scales and all that jazz, but never paid close attention since I was happy with just playing-by-notes at the time.

Suffice it to say I regret that a little now, but ah well. Never too late to (re)learn...!
</div>

Organization continues to be a menace and a fiend, which is why I tend to sort everything by date since it's the only objective measure possible at any point ever.

On which note, there's more where those came from:
<div class="notes links" markdown="1">
### assorted links of interest <span class="later">[which mostly turned into music recs]</span>
- [headspace-hotel's writings on plants](https://www.tumblr.com/headspace-hotel/tagged/plants) (mentioned in the 1/1 ramblepost but worth linking again)

	- <span class="later">[Both these sites are alternative frontends to Twitter and YouTube, respectively; you may have noticed the videos here are linked to "piped.video" and not "youtube.com". Good for privacy, pageload, and not being bombarded with ads and unwanted "recommendations"!

	- <span class="later">[uhh I don't remember how far I'd gotten at this point so I just linked a compilation video; no spoiler context, just backgrounds and titles]</span>

<div class="notes" markdown="1">

	- uploaded <b>[a thing](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/--948448397) <span class="later">(mega giant spoiler warning!!!)</span></b> on dA yesterday
- 2/7 [<i>Get to Heaven</i> is a good album](https://piped.video/watch?v=3CxOqZValYw&list=PLpdncYt1E9FjsIkAQ21GJ-MQxXRrZ0ioZ&index=11)

</div>
<div class="footnotes" markdown="1">
<span class="ast" id="piano2">\*</span> Bonus music rec: [this cover has set a wicked high bar for all video game music transcriptions ever](https://piped.video/watch?v=Mf0z-IWbg7o). Like, [the original track](https://piped.video/watch?v=RBi_kg6l9AE) is already great, and made to loop like most video game music, but the piano cover? üëåüëåüëå <i>Top Fucking Notch</i>, turns it into a whole symphony with dramatic bravado and everything. (Fun as hell to play, too!)

...That said, uh, 90% of piano versions of video game music (if not most non-piano-music) bore me now, because they don't have nearly enough variation and, in the case of songs initially made to repeat indefinitely, kind of just cut off awkwardly with a chord if even that :,D I feel like if I had a better handle on theory it'd be a *lot* easier to D.I.Y. a cover or two with a more satisfactory progression.... We shall see? For now I'm just winging it with chords.
</div>

So That's Been My Month...!

## omori.
[This game](https://www.omori-game.com/en) is utterly, disgustingly, all-consumingly *good*. It's *my* blog and I will devote a subsection to yell about it if I want to.

Okay, ready?

<div id="aaa"><div id="aaaa">AAAAA<a href="#cont" style="position:absolute; left:-999px; width:1px; height:1px; top:auto; overflow:hidden;"> (the rest of this is just a long string of A that should go off the screen, here is an invisible link for screenreaders to skip it) </a>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</div></div>

<a id="cont"></a>Man, is it nice to have custom CSS. I digress, though.

*This fucking game, man.* It's really, *really* difficult to talk about why I love it so much without getting into spoilers (I *highly* recommend playing blind, and this is from someone who usually gorges on spoilers at the first opportunity), but I will try:

A boy and his friends go on adventures! A good chunk of the game takes place in a happy little dreamscape---but it's not filed under 'psychological horror' (and rated M, to boot) for nothing. Heed the warnings, and know I've seen a lot of people end up *utterly depressed* in the aftermath---and after finishing the main route myself, *hoo boy*, I can see why.

That Said!! I'd describe it more as a rollercoaster with a specialty in atmosphere (both in playful highs *and* horrifying lows) than an all-out tragedy- or horror-fest. I'm not kidding when I say it pretty much threw me through the entire gamut of human emotion, and I had a *delightful* time trying to pick the story and its themes apart as I went along. Needless to say, it still lives in my head rent-free, and I expect it to be there for, uh, Some Amount Of Time.

It's been a *while* since I was this obsessed with something, tbh. I hadn't voluntarily gotten into anything new in months, mostly because I thought this precise all-consuming fixation would punc me in the face again, and that's not a *problem* per say but I also wanted to focus more on original work. That said, brain was itching for something new to latch onto, and *lo and behold*. A number on my sleep schedule, it's done, but by and large I regret nothing.

I also sorta wanna make a little fansite for it to dump my art and particularly meta, since I don't have a good outlet for the latter & don't want to get back into social media *just* for that >_>\" Some of my thoughts are a little, uh, [Galaxy Brain](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20481008) anyway (that link is a compliment btw), and while I'd love discussion, the fanbase seems really young and I don't want to prod the beast lmao. Maybe I'll finally cave and get an Ao3 account or something. But *then* I feel like I need to make some kind of Polished Comprehensive Writeup and askdhadsksdghsdjkssdf <i>listne my personal note-to-self discord is a slapdash shitshow and I liveblogged like 90% of the game in a friend's DMs</i>, so, um. We'll, uh... ~we'll see~, as always and ever.

TL;DR üÖ±Ô∏èlease [Play Gaem](https://www.omori-game.com/en)

## the Dreamwidth comment thing + closing thoughts
Oh yeah, I mentioned [last post](eleven#general-goals-etc) that I might use Dreamwidth as a glorified RSS feed. And ~guess what~! You can now tell me if there's interest in that, or say whatever the heck else you want, because I remembered Dreamwidth also has an anonymous comment feature (and doesn't scalp your data like a Google Form or what have you), and so [this exists now](https://a-notebox.dreamwidth.org/2023/01/31/welcome.html?style=site)! It's, uh, not the end of the month or anything, but I guess the midpoint is also a good a time as any.

Speaking of last post, I have also done 0 (None) Thing [noted there](eleven#miscellaneous-things-i-want-to-do-at-some-point), buuuut again you'll see it here if/when it happens.

For now, I think this is a nice step towards Using My Own Site More \o/ Self-indulgent prattling aside, [here's the link again to drop me a line](https://a-notebox.dreamwidth.org/2023/01/31/welcome.html?mode=reply&style=site), thanks for reading, and "see" ya next update~
