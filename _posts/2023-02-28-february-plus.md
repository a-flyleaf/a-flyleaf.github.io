I have really got to update this page layout but for now I continue to copypaste an unholy wall of page-specific CSS.

## February notedump
No topic splits no gods no masters. Only dates.

Mostly music, with a spattering of other stuff.
<div class="notes" markdown="1">
- 13: [song](https://piped.video/watch?v=2yHGUoozvLI) via [good-ass dance video](https://piped.video/watch?v=foEDIiSNbAY)

	- [<i>Yume Nikki</i> OST](https://piped.video/watch?v=EGM8-YN5B64), in search of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Omori</span> parallels. mostly remembered why droning ambiance tends to turn my brain into mush (<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Off</span> does this too with a couple tracks)<span class="em">---</span>but I *do* listen to a majority of Black Space to relax so ??????? idk how that works
	- dA: <b>[Nothing but static.](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/Nothing-but-static-949588069)</b>
- 16: gnosticism talk → oh hey, this <i>Homestuck</i> analysist I read ages ago talked about this → ends up ignoring the analyst's Gnostic talk and reading some other articles that piqued my interest
	- <span class="ivory">[Self Portrait as a Fused Gem: Steven Universe and 20th Century Art](https://www.stormingtheivorytower.com/2016/08/self-portrait-as-fused-gem-steven.html)</span><span class="em">---</span>I don't think I even *watched* this episode, but I do love me some Dadaist analysis
	- <span class="ivory">[Happily Ever After Never Ends: Steven Universe the Movie and Serial Narrative](https://www.stormingtheivorytower.com/2019/09/happily-ever-after-never-ends-steven.html)</span><span class="em">---</span>ah yes, I remember watching this film around the time the <i>Homestuck</i> epilogues released, and binging an actual fuckton of meta about The Nature Of A Narrative Ending and psychological implications because life doesn't actually end until it's *really* over, all that good meta/existential stuff. Weirdly foramtive, in retrospect. Between this and <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Omori</span> I am *all for* this newer trend of saying "y'know, maybe 'happily ever after' is too simple, but we can still *be* happy."
		- Had a pivotal influence on <i>404</i>, I should note. (or, well, the linear version with a The End™ that I was toying with for a while.) Just, like, to quote the article: "<span class="ivory">If the story continues, that means continuing to reinscribe trauma.</span>" (also as a side note this is not the first time I've notedumped snippets but usually they go in like, the personal discord chat or random txt files. This one is actually intended for publication, which could have interesting ramifications for my general workflow and thought-dumps and all that jazz.)
	- Breaking the notedumping for a moment, actually, like... do I have to *prove* to anyone that I read long articles and books and listen to a broad range of music and what have you, nah. There's some niggling compulsion that I do, anyway, because otherwise sometimes I'm looking at swaths of days and wondering what the hell I'm doing. But more optimistically, I also just find what influences people *really fucking fascinating.* I've always loved behind-the-scenes stuff, bonus content, people talking about what drove them to make a thing or why they interpreted it in such-and-such way. Presumptuous of me to think other people might be interested in my own thought process? Well Actually No because I know awesome people who have reassured me, yeah, there's *someone* besides me who gets a kick out of little asides and other notes that might be scrubbed from a professional drawing board but it's *me* so they're not. But also, most egocentric of all, *I* like it. I&nbsp;Just Think It's Neat. End&nbsp;thesis.

	- "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" ([original](https://piped.video/watch?v=0m4aoeN42tE) + [Lorde](https://piped.video/watch?v=0m4aoeN42tE)), [Yellow Flicker Beat](https://piped.video/watch?v=e1S9HUNoI4k)

	- today I woke up with [this song](https://piped.video/watch?v=IZzH94TetIE) in my head first thing in the morning which prompted a small binge of the <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Lisa</span> OST from my browser history. I've never actually played this game but the soundtrack *slaps*
		- [Men's Hair Club](https://piped.video/watch?v=ByKll4eIjwo) · [Summer Love](https://piped.video/watch?v=1AKkLEoixkw) · [666&nbsp;Kill Chop&nbsp;Deluxe](https://piped.video/watch?v=_J0wkwgTbvc) · [Forever&nbsp;Turbo Heat&nbsp;Dance](https://piped.video/watch?v=EQVsQsUmu-I)
		- bonus shout-out to [Noisemaster](https://noisemaster.bandcamp.com/music), whose remixes and tunes in general are both Real Fuckin Neato; ~~some picks~~ the only one I actually remembered to link, apparently: [All that Glitters](https://piped.garudalinux.org/watch?v=F-RKIJiiNC4)
	- unrelatedly, discovered [<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Omori</span> Heardle](https://omori-heardle-2-5.glitch.me/)! I got [today's track](https://omori.bandcamp.com/track/acrophobia) right in less than a second ayyy
- 23: going through [bubblebaath's blog](https://bubblebaath.tumblr.com/) again because I love it, and their music (particularly [this track](https://bubblebaath.tumblr.com/post/700782847223627776), which prompted me to stop and jot this down) gives me serious [PilotRedSun](https://pilotredsun.bandcamp.com/)/[PilotRedSky](https://pilotredsky.bandcamp.com/music) vibes. two recs for the price of one!
- 24: the [<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Ena</span> OST](https://piped.video/playlist?list=PLDg-1MHo18OQmKakdxGwoLLX-FP6IIaiR) is a quirky thing indeed

	- <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Omori site live babey!!!</em>
	- updated [the devaintArt tag reference](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/deviantart/gallery-tag-reference/)
	- dA: <b>[roundup (which is literally just <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Omori</span>)](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-2023-02-artspace-2-sitelink-951613084)</b>

~yeah~

## The Fansite.
"I want to make an <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Omori</span> site to dump my art and particularly meta" *&gt;works on the art pages second-to-last **&gt;thinks of a billion other things to add and finishes most of those before adding a drop of meta***

...Uh. Well. Despite that. [It's live!!](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/) It's got a splash page (#ThrowbackTuesday amirite) and everything! I had a lot of fun making it, and it's nice to have a little designated Obsession Space™. Having the core site done also means I'm *that* much closer to finally letting myself play the other route (I want to round up observations from the first playthrough (and since then) before diving in, especially since a majority of the route is apparently the same and I figure giving it a break will make the experience feel less repetitive), and I forgot where this sentence was going but ~yeah that's a thing~.

Not gonna lie, there's a part of me that thinks this is a little excessive/hasty; I mean, I've had other All-Consuming Hyperfixations and they haven't gotten their own websites, and I'm barely over a full 30 days into this one. Who's to say the interest won't drop off, like, as soon as I finish reviewing the playthrough if not before then? I *severely* doubt that, but it's a possibility! What if what if what if [insert more anxiety brain scrargling here] ("scrargling" is not a word but it is the closest approximation to the sound I'm imagining)

To that I say a few things:
- I was doing different things with my internet time back then, and lord knows I don't know what to do with all the semi-ephemeral blog posts *that's* produced. Also, I *have* had fleeting thoughts of going back and making fansites for other media I've made a substantial amount of fanart for; jury's still out on whether I'll get around to those, but it's usually more tempting to spend my time on, y'know, *current* interests instead.
- If (and when, whether in a few days or weeks or years from now) the interest fades, so what? The site exists. It's cool. It's a neat little time capsule. I am Narcissus and the stuff I drop all over the internet is a deep pool indeed. (Or, a bit less self-deprecatingly: recycling is a concept!)
- This anxiety brain scrargling is ultimately some mix of internalized #cringe and "But You Have To Spend Your Time *Productively*™©®," and in response to both I offer the weariest of sighs. Fear of public disapproval is a bitch and a half but this is *my* website and I do what I want, including note-rambles that would belong in a therapy session <span style="display:inline-block;">&gt;:V</span>

...Anyway! Project page update TBA, along with [all those other goals lingering from last month](eleven#miscellaneous-things-i-want-to-do-at-some-point). That is all!
