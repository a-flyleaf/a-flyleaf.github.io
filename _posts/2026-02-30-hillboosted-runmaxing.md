The other day I watched a video titled "[Everybody wants to waste your time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56EyKNjhUDYe)," some commentary about how videos and Netflix documentaries and YouTube videos and social media and video games all seem needlessly bloated these days. I agree! Brevity is the soul of wit. Alas, your noble writer is [mad](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brevity_is_the_soul_of_wit). <!--more-->

↑ a friend in the bugjar, 2026. Sent to me personally. Delightful. Inspiring. To memorialize it somewhere that isn't a semi-ephemeral blogpost, I stuck it on [my neocities index](https://a-flyleaf.neocities.org/), which as of this update no longer redirects automatically to this site.

Okay, that's the most important thing about this post. You've seen it now. Class dismissed.

## yeah but what about the chicken

As per often, I had a small handful of Things I Would Like To Do in the [last](augh#2026-will-you-do-enough) [couple](vignette#idea) posts. We're over a week into the second month of the new year. Did I, at least do something ✨new✨ last month?

Sure. Ate food. Was good.

Also, I completely forgot about the entire goal and instead spent about half my January playing **vibeo gaem**.

<i>Where Winds Meet</i> is a free-to-play— <em style="font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">wait wait let me finish</em> it's a free game where you run around fantasy ancient China doing open world things, like getting your shit wrecked by a surprisingly well-structured linear plot, doing 500 sidequests before ever touching the main goalposts, button-mashing through fights while being gradually taught to button-mash less mindlessly, and chasing butterflies. It's pretty fun, it's effectively a [triple-A game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)) with a pricetag of $0, and I wouldn't have chucked ten bucks at it if it wasn't.

"But a-flyleaf dot github dot com," you may be thinking, "since when were you A&nbsp;Gamer™? *And* you spent money on it?? Also, how the hell is this free. There must be a catch." All good and valid thoughts!

### r/IAmNotAGamer
Real talk: I downloaded this to use as a glorified facemaker.

Look at--- okay. Look at [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20251201011307/https://wherewindsmeet.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Where-Winds-Meet/character-creation-3-character-creation-wwm-wiki-guide-min.jpg) [shit](https://web.archive.org/web/20240502131721/https://www.gamerguides.com/assets/media/23/350/where_winds_meet_preview_5-1255670d.jpg). What the hell is a philtrum. That is a level of facial fine-tuning that I'd only expect in like, idk, an actual 3d model of a face. It's in-depth to the point of excess (I don't notice a difference with about half of the teeny little angle tweaks), but I think it's extremely cool as a feature that exists.

I made a main character's face (you gotta actually Start a game before unlocking the menus for proper polygon play-dough), futzed around with a couple others, figured I might as well *try* to play the game since it (surprisingly) downloaded successfully and the lag wasn't horrific, and *ah welp there goes the month*.

It would be very easy to gush about the different ways in which Game Good. It ate my free time for many days in a row for a reason, and I do feel like it's rewarded that time ~investment well without relying on predatory pay-to-win nonsense. Progress is made not (just) in stat numbers going up (frankly I pay them very little attention), but in getting to explore a huge, *huge* fucking map with even more NPCs and sub-locations to discover---and that's just in the first region! I've stalled the story, on purpose, in what's effectively the prologue chapter! Gaem Free, what the hell!!

<br>
One of the articles I stumbled upon, in an on-and-off attempt to wrap my head around the weapons system, is titled "[<i>Where Winds Meet</i> is Wasting Your Time](https://www.neonlightsmedia.com/blog/where-winds-meet-efficiency-guide-daily-weekly)."

>  This isn't a guide for "enjoying the scenery." This is a guide for players who respect their own time.

Well. Sure. If you want to be Optimizer Extraordinaire, yeah, this is a good guide for it. You'll be caught up for competitive online play soon enough, I guess, and get to wait for the level cap to rise like everyone else on that peak plateau. Wow.

You know, that's not really my idea of fun, personally. All the more to y'all in the competitive number-crunching spheres. If I sound a bit dry here it's as deliberate response to the framing of slow progression as "wasting your time," which is clickbaity on top of being condescending---*except!*

> Look, <i>Where Winds Meet</i> is a long haul. It's designed to be a "forever game," which is corporate-speak for "an endless grind."

Objectively. This is a true statement.

You know that plot and story I've mentioned? It's, uh. It's not done yet. It's not done in the Chinese servers, which are at least a full region ahead of global release, and (given the nature of the thing) probably *will not* be over for many, many years.

Cool...?

### the inevitable catch
Theoretically. You *could* play the game's storyline, entirely solo, zero interaction with the online features and monetization and everything, and just be patient and wait for chapters to release every few months. Lord knows the game has more than enough stuff to do to help full that interim time, assuming you're not pouncing on the nearest guide to make Completionism Percentage Go Up. (Er, not a dig. I do that.)

Except for the part where you click the wrong thing and get an illness so severe the NPC doc can't treat it, so it's either find another player to treat you or deal with the debuffs indefinitely. Except for [a mechanic](https://gamerant.com/where-winds-meet-bounty-system-explained/) wherein you can log in and just get killed instantly by some rando. Except for the "signposts" left by other players, scattered about the landscape wherever they've deemed fit, which you'll see by default.

Except that the current Lunar New Year event is only playable online---which, sure, you can ignore it. But you are going to at least *look* at it, because you get event notices upon loading the game & it's the only way to clear those "new!" symbols on your menu.

In other words: No, you don't *have* to interact with the online features. The game isn't pay-to-win, and (knock on wood) there have been [developer statements](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/new-mmo-on-the-block-where-winds-meet-promises-to-never-become-pay-to-win-greeting-players-with-the-message-your-legend-is-written-by-skill-and-choice-never-by-wallet-size/) vowing to never implement them. They make their money through the [cosmetics gacha](https://old.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1qxchpb/the_new_event_is_atrocious/), surely [other MMOs](https://www.ingamenews.com/2025/10/sword-of-justice-no-grind-mmorpg.html), and [$40k <span style="text-transform:lowercase;font-variant:small-caps;">USD</span> boats](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/who-tf-bought-the-damn-40k-usd-boat-where-winds-meet-fans-can-only-stand-agape-as-one-mmo-whale-drops-enough-money-for-a-real-car-on-an-in-game-mount-within-a-week-of-launch/). Maybe (and, [citation needed], but possibly still worth noting) also with wherever all their AI [face](https://thegameslayer.com/guides/where-winds-meet-smart-customization-options-explained/) and voice\* and [text](https://game8.co/games/Where-Winds-Meet/archives/565812#hl_5) and [video](https://game8.co/games/Where-Winds-Meet/archives/579440) data is going, too.

Here's the thesis of this meandering not-so-little would-be-review-essay: I have mixed feelings about this game. I like what it offers, as a solo and very-occasionally-online experience. I am less enthused by the pseudo-MMO aspects, which it... doesn't *shove* in your face, no, but they're not *not* there and it's hard to ignore those facets wholesale.

I don't know. I don't play masively multiplayer online role-playing games. For all I know, these aspects which give me pause are just bog standard MMO fare. I'm still wary about it, and I don't love it.

Without consciously trying to, I hit the top tier of last season's [battle pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_pass) and figured, what the fuck, I got most of that by playing blithely along the story's progression and probably won't max it out again for a hot minute. I'd pay $10 flat for a game like this. I don't hate the spotlight outfit. (I did not really pay attention to the interim boons. Chicken included.) It's a one-off purchase. So, I chucked ten dollars at the premium battle pass, because I have $10 in disposable income, and... I don't know, it's by no means a small indie project where the devs *need* increments of Ten Dollar to stay afloat. It's a personal indulgence, sure, but it wasn't something I *wanted* until it was presented to me.

Thus, here I am prattling hundreds of words about it on my barely-professional blog, in what could probably be a concise review with a thesis if I wanted to make it one. I don't, though.

I like the game. Would I recommend it blithely without a few caveats? Not necessarily. But I don't think I've wasted my time playing it, thinking about it, and now writing about it. Whether I've wasted *your* time, assuming you've read this far, is a value judgment only you get to make.

Chimken hat.

There's probably Even More Post in me yet. Here's the bullet version because I'm tired of being verbose.
- AI ambivalence continues to be ambivalent, though I have noticed a Discrepancy in how I approach generative media in text vs imagery vs video. strange and inconsistent of me I will admit. further investigation needed.
- forget the water factoid tho. What About [The <em style="text-transform:uppercase;">Corn</em> 🌽](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_c6MWk7PQc)
- sometimes I say things and only afterward realize <i>hm that was kind of an odd thing to say/think/be doing</i>. unfortunate for my hermitic tendencies. I was going to take this month "off" <i>WWM</i> (3d chicken game, if you skipped the dropdown) and get back to Wolvden for its own little event, but I sure did describe the latter as "pixel micromanagement game" and had to be like. ok wait. that sounds dull as shit. and truth be told I only picked it up as a time-filler in the first place, and I think I no longer need to be doing that. cool. anyway
- what is an in-game photo mode if not for making you think <i>I could be taking real photos</i> or at least <i>I could be relearning how to make 3d models and then adjusting whatever the fuck I want from there</i> and also <i>these are disparate but not wholly-unrelated skillsets & none of them are half as fast or easy as Alt+F7 → tweak settings → Spacebar, save, done</i>. help,
