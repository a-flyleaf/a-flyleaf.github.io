			<h2>about</h2><!--this whole thing can be in a separate page ("index" as a "launch" page? man THAT'S a throwback) but for the sake of Getting Content In it'll just be here for now. may or may not revise for formality later but I think the rambly, casual tone here fits the "canon what canon" thing-->
			
			<h3>who are these people</h3>
			<p>characters who I‚Äôm not doing anything with wheeeee</p>
			
			<h3>why ‚Äúcmyk‚Äù</h3>
			<p>‚Äúcmyk‚Äù is what the folder on my computer is called, because at some point in ~2018 I thought it‚Äôd be cool to give them that sort of color theming. it didn‚Äôt really Stick (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model">the technicalities of print colors</a> have basically nothing to do with anyone‚Äôs story) but it‚Äôs considerably shorter than ‚Äú<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23disasterduo">disaster duo</a> <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23disasterduoandpals">(and pals)</a>‚Äù</p>
			
			<h3>what is the Lore</h3>
			<p>basically I had this duo who I wanted to flesh out more, and in the process of overhauling their backstories I ended up with this entire litle cast. floated around a few ideas for what to <em>do</em> with them all, in terms of making A Single Interconnected Canonical Story, but nothing really Stuck and my interest wandered. so now they are in this weird sort of limbo where they‚Äôre very much interconnected, but thaaaat‚Äôs about it. it‚Äôs entirely possible a story or two will be branched off and/or recycled for other projects whenever.</p>
			<p>still, the dubious canonicity makes them great for little one-off things like this! so here we are.</p>
			
			<h3>no, but like, what‚Äôs the <em>in-world</em> lore</h3>
			<ul><li>the years ‚Äú2012‚Äù and ‚Äú2017‚Äù refer to an in-story timeline, <em>not</em> real-life years</li>
			<li>everything else should be considered a puzzle piece for you to put together however you want, for lack of Solidly Defined Canon</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>are these Original Characters Do Not Steal‚Ñ¢?</h3>
			<p>yes and no. yes: they sure are characters, and we can have a long and interesting conversation about what differentiates an ‚ÄúOC‚Äù from Just A Character. no: Nico and Ivy started out as pok√©mon people so jot that down,</p>
			<p>also originality is overrated, everything is derivative; if something about these guys speaks to you and you wanna make a recolor or ‚Äústeal‚Äù what details I‚Äôve provided, <em>go for it!</em> your version‚Äôs yours, mine is mine, and while I‚Äôd appreciate credit for whatever you‚Äôre drawing from (especially if someone asks, and/or you try to pass it off as 100% Yours), that‚Äôs just a matter of creative honesty imo.</p>
			<p>in other words, if you happen to have a character that looks and/or is written really really <em>really</em> similar to mine‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs cool with me, man. keep doin‚Äô your thing üëç</p>
			
			<h3>can I draw them?</h3>
			<p>-takes a deep breath-</p>
			<p><strong><em>Yes.</em></strong></p>
			<p>you do not need to ask and you do not need to show me (although chances are I‚Äôd love to anyway, <em>wink wink nudge nudge</em>). there are design notes provided both via image and writing, but unless I‚Äôm specifically requesting this art from you (in a commission or trade or something), don‚Äôt even worry about it. I just like to overthink the little details ;V</p>
			
			<h3>do these laissez-faire ideas about originality and drawing ‚Äúpermissions‚Äù apply to <em>all</em> your creative work?</h3>
			<p>hell yeah dude!!!!</p>
