nico: maniwaaaa. there was another one at some point but i forgot rip
ivy: that one gumball clip, not sure if I ever found something for her as an adult
ava: . . . monika ddlc.
tara: wendy gravityfalls
vexus: cavetown in that one (1) song, iirc. and the kid from the onion commercial
levi: never had one I don't think??
dodder: idfk


meta
- general: started with N+I (then Nathan(iel) or Nate + ...Ivy) as pokemon headcanon protags, which was a longtime habit. kinda left them in postgame stasis once TFE came along, I thiiiink I had vague ideas of their adult selves? mainly that they were miserable forever rip in rest
- revisited arounnd 2017/8, as TFE was winding down. entire "canon" got overhauled as a completely original modern thing; "Hugh" and sister became Tara and Vexus, and new people (Ava, Levi, Dodder) spawned; played with that cruise ship concept (that would've aged like milk)
- ^that never really crystallized as A Thing, creative interests kinda wandered before eventually latching onto DDLC/404. haven't really revisited them since
- well ok that's a lie, every once in a while I'll toss around a standalone story idea. haven't Committed to anything though, and (at the time of writing) I feel like I'd want to change a LOT, even rebuild from the ground up, because theme and tone n shit. they're theoretically a Real Grounded Modern story but the backstory is SUPER melodramatic, and the Realistic and Grounded:tm: tone I had in mind would probably fit raw prose better
- that said these people still skew more realistic than cartoony, at least compared to stories like 404 (half-n-half On Purpose) and Ygbtdm (I have not actually considered most people's intricate backstories for shit because it's not relevant; that one was built theme-up, sorta).
- and so BASICALLY, these guys are excellent candidates for the ripoff-Toyhou.se idea: characters that Exist and Have Stories, but are unlikely to debut in proper narrative format any time soon.

meta: specific character patterns, because i AM obsessed with my own work thank you very much. a lot of these guys' stories and/or designs recurs in my other stuff (thinking primarily of 404 and Ygbtdm here, since both were created *after* the seven here), which retroactively makes some of these look like ripoffs or repeats, but they came first. I just think it's neat when artists/storytellers revisit ideas n shit, gotta recycle ideas fast, all that jazz SO! here is mine.
- Nico: spawned the Depression Hoodie:tm: before serena made it canon. has a fair bit in common with Sequitur for that Depressed Stoner vibe but that was more coincidence than intention.
	- oh also GUILT ISSUESSSS can't forget those, they alllll started (well, first cropped up?) with this dude
- Ivy: along with Nico, first iteration of this "straight man + goofball" duo, kind of. (which is a MAJOR simplification but still.) modern!Kay Lin totally #stoleHerLook which I think is very funny.
	- when I was first developing her I basically wrote a textbook "narcissistic parent + codependent child" dynamic without knowing that was a diagnosable Pattern, and was *over the goddamn moon* to learn I'd hit so many nails on the fucked-up psychological heads. it was like being #validated in realism points by the DSM. not that I'm gonna claim anything I write is #hashtagRealisticRepresentation of anything, but still, thought that was fun
- Tara: before I started writing about human people I wrote a lot about animals and often had generic decent everyman protags. Tara is like that but genderbent I think, but with more Intention:tm:--there's a *lot* of reasons she's kind of generically nice and most of them are related to repression issues. that said I do kinda feel like she deserved better, from a "did not get Into writing her as much as other characters (in the 2018 stint)" standpoint. (and, like, She Fuckin Dies to catalyze other peoples' character development, but that was kiiiiinda built in from the direction I took with the original pokemon headcanon thing. ah well.)
	- her and Vexus' dynamic is... it's not *recycled* in Kade/Rudy by a long shot but there are shades of it? especially in the KR backstory, where Kade's trying *really hard* to set a Good Example and Rudy is just not having it. but in the Tara/Vexus case it's more that Vexus was seemingly unreceptive in general, and Tara didn't, uh, *live* long enough for any frustrations to really boil over here.
- Ava: WALKED SO VAL AND KAY LIN (AND TRACES OF MANY OTHERS) COULD FUCKIN *RUN*. she was SUPPOSED to be a Shy Anxious UwU self-victimizing little shit, as was Levi later, and the idea stuck to NEITHER of them i still find that so fucking funny. (years later it would *finally* find a home in Ygbtdm's Caleb.) but seriously I wrote like, a 20-page google doc in one prolonged go for a friend, allllll about the Process of developing Ava's shit and (to a lesser extent? I haven't reread it in ages) how her traits have made their way into other, more-story-connected people of mine. the hair curl (kind of), flippant/casual/way-too-upbeat attitude with mildly concerning interests? Val. the color scheme of Ava's 2017 version? Addison. the vague "creepy child" vibes, and also (to a lesser degree) attitude? Kay Lin. who will bastardize Ava's traits next? it is a mystery dot em P three.
- Vexus: ah, the "grumpy outcast kid who means well and really needs a friend but is really abrasive in the mean time" archetype. for some reason this is a recurring Thing with me, especially as siblings: Bruce Brandt (an effectively-unused backstory character from *TFE*), Rudy (as introduced), Joce as a kid... Joce even kinda "stole" his Token Color, although at a different characterization point. (she is also not a sibling.)
	- Vexus is one of the characters I keep going back to for potential standalone stuff, because his story feels frustratingly incomplete. like, his sister's dead, he has a Hunch that her childhood friends Nico and Ivy had something to do with it (and he's right!!), but he's 14 years old and thus has very limited capacity to Do Anything about it. I've always liked the idea of him meeting some version of Ava, whether she lives to 2017 and they meet through some twist of ~~coincidence~~ circumstance, or she died in 2012 and is a ghost. And she probably helps... I don't wanna say *pull him away from* Levi, but there are some serious boundary issues going on with those two and Ava's presence (kid or adult) sets a *much*-needed standard that Vexus eventually realizes Levi's not meeting. So Ya Know. something something that relationship dissolving occurs in tandem with Vexus "moving on" from his sis (or, well, the older I get the more I realize people never truly Move On 100% Done No More Issues Anymore Yay, it just becomes more of a background haze than Constant Pain)--except that's also kind of fucked because Vexus' hunch is *right*???? IDK MAN.
- Levi: blythe 2 but not a furfrou. something about her never quite Clicked; she's still kinda at that phase where I have the character Idea but their dialogue and mannerisms don't feel natural or *alive* to me yet. which is kind of unfortunate because he's a lot of fun, or at least could be, having one of this cast's brasher personalities. as mentioned above the "plot" would probably end up with Vexus leaving him, although that *is* a little sad because Levi's also a very troubled kid who isn't gonna magically stop existing just because the story's over. if anything that could be the catalyst for Greater Relationship Hell. IDK. in retrospect I don't think I was being very fair to this character (in that I had very obvious Author Bias of "this one is the Designated Bad Friend") and that's definitely something I'd want to remedy given a hypothetical future revisit.
	- P.S. he gets his face shape (round rectangle) and nose shape from Serena's mom. like, not DIRECTLY (they are not related, different canons), but I blatantly and intentionally recycled those features. I think I've used this face shape like, ~four times now? (Gabriel Brandt also has it, albeit with a rounder head; the eighth Ygbtdm character had it for a time; and more recently Gary's "claimed" it.) wack.
	- also I don't have many characters with glasses OR braces, which is kind of a shame (some don't look half bad with 'em), but they're also an extra Thing to draw and I am not in the habit of giving characters many accessories, period. I treat character design like an animator on a low budget, which means the less little details to remember, the better >_>"
- Dodder: prooooobably the only one who hasn't been significantly recycled, trait- or backstory-wise, if only because I don't really have any other Middle-Aged Men:tm: in the roster? some parts of his outfit have been "reused" a lot but it's just like, a generic button-down with tie and work pants and sometimes a trenchcoat. his hair's also stylized similarly to Diana Ygbtdm's, who coincidentally also wears a tie, so that's funny. but yeah, uh, this guy Sure Does Exist All Right. good for him.
	- the whole Thing he has in 2017, about starting a self-help ??business that is also highkey a cult, is still a really interesting idea to me. it doesn't really *need* to be connected to anyone else here, tbh. but it also kind of totally is because N+I backstory and Levi's dad and ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
