		<h1>about a-flyleaf.github.io</h1><ul>
			<li>technically a handful of smaller websites <s>in a trenchcoat</s> on a subdomain</li>
			<li>formality level varies; expect lots of words and art</li>
			<li>Design also varies! The “brand” is the person and a-flyleaf got kinda sick of trying to shoehorn an entire internet home into a professional and consistent little box.</li>
		</ul><ul>
			<li><a href="projects">Projects™</a> took a substantial amount of time to make; <a href="shriblets">shriblets</a> are one-offs.</li>
			<li><a href="blog">The blog</a> is also a thing that exists, and as of 2023 compiles updates from throughout the site on a monthly basis.</li>
		</ul>
