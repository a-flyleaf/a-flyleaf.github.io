				<h2>who</h2>
				<p><b>a-flyleaf</b> is a pseudonymous internet nerd. Can often be found doing digital art, banging away at HTML/CSS, or wrangling some kind of story. Sometimes these activities even go together!</p>
				<ul><li>bullet-point-overuser</li>
				<li>meta-appreciator</li>
				<li>archival-enjoyer</li>
				<li>trying to be less of a perfectionist</li></ul>

			<section>
				<h2>what</h2>
				<p>A dubiously-organized hodge-podge of smaller sites <s>in a trenchcoat</s> on a subdomain.</p>
				<ul><li><a href="{{site.url}}/projects">The <b>Projects</b>™ page</a> showcases some stories and websites I’ve spent some substantial amount of time on. Check ’em out if you want ;V</li>
				<li><a href="{{site.url}}/shriblets"><b>shriblets</b></a> are one-off pages where I screw around with coding. Not as in-depth, obviously, but still fun little romps in their own right~</li>
				<li>There is also <a href="{{site.url}}/blog">a blog</a> here, which gets updated whenever. No set topics, no schedule, no masters.</li></ul>
			</section>
			
			<section id="contact">
				<h2>where</h2>
				<p>(AKA obligatory contact section)</p>
				<ul><li>if this ever fails to work assume I am dead: E-mail is <a href="mailto:a-flyleaf@pm.me">a-flyleaf@protonmail.net</a>; spambots do not interact!!!1!</li>
				<li>also a safe bet: You can drop me an anonymous line through <a href="https://a-notebox.dreamwidth.org/2023/01/31/welcome.html?style=site">this Dreamwidth post masquerading as a guestbook</a>. Reliant on me checking Dreamwidth, but I do that fairly often as of mid-2023.</li>
				<li>I also use <a href="https://nightauctor.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a> with some degree of regularity, although I am starting to dislike it a lot (and you need an account to contact anyone) so this one’s shaky.</li></ul>

				<h2>when</h2>
				<p>Do you want a painstaking breakdown of exactly when I do what on every other page? Me too! Which is why most of my sites* have a changelog; it may or may not be visibly-linked, but slap a /changelog to the end of the base URL and you might find something. (*Main one not included, ironically. The blog’s the closest I got here.)</p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/a-flyleaf">My GitHub commit history</a> also auto-updates every time I hit publish. It’s a lil fluky since I often have updates sitting on my computer ready to publish whenever, but hey.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>why</h2>
				<p>Social media is a data-sucking hellscape and it makes my brain break out in algorithmically-induced hives. Formatting limitations suck, arbitrary UI changes suck, being constantly subject to the whims of paywalls and CEOs and advertisers—It’s A Lot Of Suck, all the way down.</p>
				<p>Here, meanwhile, I can do basically whatever I want ;3 And you get to look at it! For free! Without logging in or anything; <a href="{{site.url}}/privacy">data-wise, I get <em>nothing</em>!!</a> And if GitHub ever mucks that up, everything is primarily on my own machine, so I can pack up and move whenever.</p>
				<p>Not a bad deal for the price of coding knowledge!</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>how</h2>
				<p>Behold, <a href="{{site.url}}">a colophon</a>!lists some resources I use/recommend. Specific code screwery also usually has nifty links adjacent somewhere, even if it’s buried in the code comments.</p>
