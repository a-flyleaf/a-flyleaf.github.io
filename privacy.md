title: A Few Notes on Privacy
---
**This is not a Privacy Policy**; I am not a lawyer.

I am not interested in your data, and thus do not use analytics, statcounters, link tracking, advertisements, or anything of that sort. You can double check this in [the repository](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/a-flyleaf.github.io) if youâ€™d like.

That said, it is **possible** that relevant services collect visitor information anyway. None of this goes to me, but in the interest of transparency:

## GitHub
This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The following note used to be on the GitHub Privacy&nbsp;Statement page:

> Please note that GitHub may collect [Technical Information](https://web.archive.org/web/20190427235834/http://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#categories-of-personal-information) from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to maintain the security and integrity of the website and service.

This changed at some point, and as of March 2023 the [Privacy&nbsp;Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230306182554/https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)) only discusses "Enterprise Marketing Pages." This is sure as hell not a GitHub marketing site, and I'm not sure if the info-collection still applies.

## Google Fonts
As of July 2022, I've made a point of not using Google Fonts, as [it sends your IP to Google](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2020/08/google-fonts-privacy/) among other techy offenses. I've replaced it with [local embeds](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts) on major pages (the first default layout & [<i>The Firebird Effect</i>]({{site.url}}/projects/tfe) page), but it's still present on older pages. May or may not get around to updating that eventually.
