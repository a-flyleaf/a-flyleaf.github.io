**This is not a Privacy Policy**; I am not a lawyer.

I am not interested in your data, and thus do not use analytics, statcounters, link tracking, advertisements, or anything of that sort. You can double check this in [the repository](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/a-flyleaf.github.io) if youâ€™d like.

That said, it is **possible** that relevant services collect visitor information anyway. None of this goes to me, but in the interest of transparency:

## GitHub
This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The following note used to be on the GitHub Privacy&nbsp;Statement page:

> Please note that GitHub may collect [Technical Information](https://web.archive.org/web/20190427235834/http://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#categories-of-personal-information) from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to maintain the security and integrity of the website and service.

This changed at some point, and as of March 2023 the [Privacy&nbsp;Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230306182554/https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)) only discusses "Enterprise Marketing Pages." This is sure as hell not a GitHub marketing site, so I'm not sure if the info-collection still applies.

## Google
Not my favorite megacorporation in the world, but I'm stuck in its omnipresent chokehold nonetheless. I try to minimize its influence here, but for the record:

- Pages from before November&nbsp;2021 may use [Google&nbsp;Fonts](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2020/08/google-fonts-privacy/). As of July&nbsp;2022, it's been replaced with [local embeds](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts) on [the old default layout](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/a-flyleaf.github.io/search?q=layout%3A+default) and [a discontinued project's pages]({{site.url}}/projects/tfe), but I&nbsp;haven't gotten around to swapping it out elsewhere.
- Art pages may have YouTube embeds, because I am not immune to convenience and occasionally work with video.

## Nitter? Piped?
Alternative frontends to Twitter and YouTube, respectively. As of September&nbsp;2024, Nitter is dead, and Piped still exists but I use Invidious way more often. There are many instances and I cycle through them periodically when others stop working.

Essentially, **the links are interchangeable**, so the megacorporate source is only a URL change away:

- <code>nitter.net/<span class="lnk">link</span></code> = <code>twitter.com/<span class="lnk">link</span></code>
- <code>piped.video/<span class="lnk">link</span></code> = <code>yewtu.be/<span class="lnk">link</span></code> = <code>youtube.com/<span class="lnk">link</span></code>

### "Frontend"? "Instance"?? What the hell are you talking about???
Ever wanted to browse ~~Twitter/~~YouTube with none of the ads, recommendations, or other bloat? *Bam*, enjoy ;V These websites essentially serve as giant embeds, and frankly I don't know enough tech talk to explain how else it works.

But I *do* know Twitter and YouTube are relentless data-munchers, and I like [open&nbsp;source](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/) projects like these on principle. The downside is that, because these sites are much smaller and entirely reliant on the host continuing to behave as expected, sometimes they just don't load---hence the note above about link interchangeability. A small price to pay for not getting unsolicited recs shoved in your face, IMO.
