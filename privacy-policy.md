I am not interested in your data, and thus do not use analytics, statcounters, ad cookies, anything of that sort. It will remain this way for the foreseeable future. You can double check this in [the repository](//github.com/a-flyleaf/a-flyleaf.github.io) if youâ€™d like.

That said, I *do* rely on external services for this website. None of the information they collect goes to me, but in the interest of transparency:

<b>I.</b> According to [the GitHub Privacy Statement](//help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#github-pages):

> Please note that GitHub may collect [Technical Information](//help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#categories-of-personal-information) from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to maintain the security and integrity of the website and service.

<b>II.</b> Discovered in late November 2021: I use Google Fonts on this and other pages, which [sends your IP to Google](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2020/08/google-fonts-privacy/). I didn't know this when implementing it, and will not be using it on new pages. That said, being a stickler for archival, I'm leaving it in older pages. Darn you, Google.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="sc">Addendum July 2022</span>: Finally got around to [embedding fonts locally](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/). This applies to [pages using the "default" layout](https://github.com/a-flyleaf/a-flyleaf.github.io/search?q=layout%3A+default) (primarily: this privacy policy, the colophon, blog posts from before 2022) and [<i>The Firebird Effect</i>]({{site.url}}/projects/tfe); other old pages are untouched for now.
