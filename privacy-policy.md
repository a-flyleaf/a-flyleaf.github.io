There is absolutely nothing in my code that collects your data. No analytics, no statcounters, no ad cookies, nothing. I intend to keep it that way. You can double check this in [the repository](//github.com/a-flyleaf/a-flyleaf.github.io) if youâ€™d like.

However, according to [the GitHub Privacy Statement](//help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#github-pages):

> Please note that GitHub may collect [Technical Information](//help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#categories-of-personal-information) from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to maintain the security and integrity of the website and service.

None of this information goes to me.
