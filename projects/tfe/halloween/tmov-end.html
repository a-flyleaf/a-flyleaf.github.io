            <p>To this day, the identity of the monster remains unconfirmed. The man attacked on October 31st was unable to provide further details before release from the hospital; approximately a month later, he was found dead in his room, apparently from suicide. Calem Chevalier succumbed to his injuries long before authorities arrived; though his cause of death was determined asphyxiation, there is no evidence his costume malfunctioned. The homicide investigation is ongoing.</p><p>By the morning of November 1st, both Serena Johnson and her delphox had vanished without a trace. Shauna Najm volunteered some information on the case and insisted neither missing person was "entirely responsible" for the attacks, though she declined to comment further. She refuses efforts at further questioning.</p><p>"It was a mistake from start to finish," Najm reported. "That's all there is to it. Go home, good day, and don't drink the water."</p>
