So you know how I've been telling you about my good ol' blockhead pal Calem? The guy who'd rather make a scary costume from scratch to scare the shit outta passing kids than actually buy candy? Yeah, that guy! There's a dead dog in his house! Wow, amazing! A big lycanroc with a snapped neck lying on the ground right near the back door! What a sight for sore eyes!</p><p>Man, I don't even know if there's anyone listening right now, I'm just calling to save myself the trouble later on but it's probably not gonna matter. LONG STORY SHORT the front door was already open, it looks like a hurricane did a backflip straight down the hallway, and BAM! [forced laughter] It just slammed this monster against the door without breaking glass and now it's on its back, on the floor, and did I mention I'm gonna need a good drink after this? Because I am. Ideally something that doesn't look anything like this big puddle of blood.</p><p>I - why, yes, I'm talking to myself, because I'm composed like that. Wait a sec.</p><p>[approximately one minute of unintelligible static]</p><p>So, if you heard any muffled upset noises in the background, that was probably my, ahem, <i>escort</i> having a meltdown. We're having fun. Fortunately she went off to - hm. Actually, letting her out of my sight might've been a bad idea, but I'll deal with that later. Right now I'm thinking I should'a got my camera fixed a <i>long</i> time ago, but forgive me for not realizing I'd be dealing with a corpse. I thought this was gonna be a nice friendly interview with an innocent guy, but nah, he just had to go all red riding hood's grandma on me.</p><p>...Okay, hold up. There's no blood coming from this thing other than the neck. Like, there are stains, especially on the arms, but the cuts aren't fleshy. At all. I don't wanna get my fingerprints on it, I'm already paranoid being within a ten mile radius, but the slices on the arm and chest look like fabri-</p><p>Oh my god.</p><p>[whispering] Calem, you fucking furry.</p><p>Well, would ya look at that, there's a trail of pawpr</p><p>[CONNECTION SEVERED, END MESSAGE]</div>

If you've returned, I'm sure you know exactly what happened after you left. I don't blame you for fleeing. With this note I ask not for your forgiveness but understanding; I doubt whatever the authorities make public will be the full story. (And should this note be picked up by anyone aside from Kojo, I'd appreciate it if you spread my words.)</p><p>Nothing prompted the attack. All I know is that the clouds cleared, I woke up, and while I was fully sentient, everything felt fake. I wasn’t thinking. I didn’t care to think. I went with it. Even in the middle of the chaos, I was not possessed, nor was it voluntary. I would describe it as living a dream, where the world is upside-down and you don’t question a thing until you wake up. I did not lose control.</p><p>I didn't wake up when I saw you arrive, try to throw me off, then run in terror when I turned on you. I didn't wake up during any of the yelling, any of the fighting. It took her neck in my jaw for me to step back, and only then did the horror set in.</p><p>Emergency services should arrive soon. Whatever they ask, I will comply. I don't expect to return home within the month, if ever.</p><p>One more thing. If they blame you for being untested, for needing shelter at an inconvenient time, for attacking me when no one was looking: I know you have not laid a claw on me since we met, and I will not be convinced otherwise. Please defend yourself. "Wild instincts" are nonsense and I stress that I did not "lose control" during the attack.</p><p>Take care.</p><p>-Alec"</p></div>
