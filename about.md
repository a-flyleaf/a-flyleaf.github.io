Hi there! You've reached the Official Websiteâ„¢ of the pseudonymous a-flyleaf, internet recluse and general nerd. This site houses scattered attempts at any/all of the following of ther nerd's interests: digital art, storytelling, HTML/CSS coding, and gratuitous run-ons. May contain swearing and other content not made for children; creator has chosen not to use archive warnings.

Social media is a hellscape and I am committed to [owning my humble little platform](https://www.alwaysownyourplatform.com/). But you can find me on [deviantART](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor) for an ongoing artchive (art archive) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJfFQQUcpUmaRLCs-hCF4A) for animations and other video shenanigans, because I am not immune to convenience.

I don't know if spambots are still a big thing in 2021 but you can also contact me by email: <span style="font-family:consolas,monospace; font-size:.85em; background:rgba(128,128,128,.15);">[name, hyphen included] + \'at\' + \'protonmail\' + \'.com\'</span>.
