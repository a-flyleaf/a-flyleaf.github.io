- OMORI, like All Of It, but with special shout-outs to: [the first battle theme](https://omori.bandcamp.com/track/tussle-among-trees)! [theme of a scene that ripped my heart out and smashed it violently on the floor](https://omori.bandcamp.com/track/it-means-everything)! [lofi spider phobia ambiance to chillax to](https://omori.bandcamp.com/track/arachnophobia)! but mostly the middle one so far (1/19) good LORD,,,,

- 1/24: more random-ass... not even *earworms* just Songs I Remembered Exist: [Good to Be Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYtBoxGB6Wo) (and by extension [Lyin' 2 Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PShRULA8sOY) but I like the first better, even had a character animatic in my head for one verse) and, uh, [Gucci Gang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9alXo1OXTec). OMORI soundtrack continues to be great too, listened to some of the area battle themes I've encountered so far

- 1/26: uhhhh listened to a whole bunch more last night just suffice it to say Soundtrack Good and i Will binge the hell out of it when I'm done here
