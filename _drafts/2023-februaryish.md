this is probably going to surpass the end of the month, we're already nearly halfway through

	- [<i>Yume Nikki</i> OST](https://piped.video/watch?v=EGM8-YN5B64), in search of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Omori</span> parallels. mostly remembered why droning ambiance tends to turn my brain into mush (<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Off</span> does this too with a couple tracks)--but I *do* listen to a majority of Black Space to relax so ??????? idk how that works

- 16: gnosticism talk -> oh hey, this Homestuck analysist I read ages ago talked about this -> ends up ignoring the Gnostic talk and reading some other articles that piqued my interest
	- [Self Portrait as a Fused Gem: Steven Universe and 20th Century Art](https://www.stormingtheivorytower.com/2016/08/self-portrait-as-fused-gem-steven.html)---I don't think I even *watched* this episode, but I do love me some Dadaist analysis
	- [Happily Ever After Never Ends: Steven Universe the Movie and Serial Narrative](https://www.stormingtheivorytower.com/2019/09/happily-ever-after-never-ends-steven.html)---ah yes, I remember watching this film around the time the Homestuck epilogues released, and binging an actual fuckton of meta about The Nature Of A Narrative Ending and psychological implications because life doesn't actually end until it's *really* over, all that good meta/existential stuff. Weirdly foramtive, in retrospect. Between this and <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Omori</span> I am *all for* this newer trend of saying "y'know, maybe 'happily ever after' is too simple, but we can still *be* happy."
		- Had a pivotal influence on <i>404</i>, I should note. (or, well, the linear version with a The End™ that I was toying with for a while.) Just, like, to quote the article: "If the story continues, that means continuing to reinscribe trauma." (also as a side note this is not the first time I've notedumped snippets but usually they go in like, the personal discord chat or random txt files. This one is actually intended for publication, which could have interesting ramifications for my general workflow and thought-dumps and all that jazz.)
	- Breaking the notedumping for a moment, actually, like... do I have to *prove* to anyone that I read long articles and books and listen to a broad range of music and what have you, nah. There's some niggling compulsion that I do, anyway, because otherwise sometimes I'm looking at swaths of days and wondering what the hell I'm doing. But more optimistically, I also just find what influences people *really fucking fascinating.* I've always loved behind-the-scenes stuff, bonus content, people talking about what drove them to make a thing or why they interpreted it in such-and-such way. Presumptuous of me to think other people might be interested in my own thought process? Well Actually No because I know awesome people who have reassured me, yeah, there's *someone* besides me who gets a kick out of little asides and other notes that might be professionally scrubbed from the drawing board. But also, most egocentric of all, *I* like it. I Just Think It's Neat. End thesis.

	- today I woke up with [this song](https://piped.video/watch?v=IZzH94TetIE) in my head first thing in the morning which prompted a small binge of the <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Lisa</span> OST from my browser history. I've never actually played this game but the soundtrack *slaps*

- 23: going through [bubblebaath's blog](https://bubblebaath.tumblr.com/) again because I love it, and their music (particularly [this track](https://bubblebaath.tumblr.com/post/700782847223627776), which prompted me to stop and jot this down) gives me serious [PilotRedSun](https://pilotredsun.bandcamp.com/)/[PilotRedSky](https://pilotredsky.bandcamp.com/music) vibes. two recs for the price of one!
- 24: the [<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Ena</span> OST](https://piped.video/playlist?list=PLDg-1MHo18OQmKakdxGwoLLX-FP6IIaiR) is a quirky thing indeed
