# Bottlenecks are a concept.
> Not gonna lie, there's a part of me that thinks [making an entire fansite for a game I *just* played at the time of writing] is a little excessive/hasty; I mean, I've had other All-Consuming Hyperfixations and they haven't gotten their own websites, and I'm barely over a full 30 days into this one. Who's to say the interest won't drop off, like, as soon as I finish reviewing the playthrough if not before then? I *severely* doubt that, but it's a possibility! What if what if what if [insert more anxiety brain scrargling here] ("scrargling" is not a word but it is the closest approximation to the sound I'm imagining)

uhh suffice it to say the site of mine that's been getting updated lately is that one, and nigh-*exclusively* that one. Also as of July I have tentatively started using Dreamwidth again (shouldn't be hard to find but I kinda like the ~semi-obscurity of it so I'm not linking directly), so that's been cool *and* scratches the semi-regular update itch. (it *does* render my blog here a bit redundant, tho.) Also also deviantArt gets worse and worse every time I check it which, combined with most of my art since January having been fanart (meaning I can upload it straight to the site, elsewhere be damned), has made me, uhh, *less than updated* to keep dA up-to-date.

idek what I'm doing online anymore let's put it that way.

## but Today:
Site's been long overdue for some updates for a *while* now; I've had a bunch of changes sitting in my local GitHub commits, so today I figured I'd actually start cleaning them up.
