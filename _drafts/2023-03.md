5/26 feeling this. https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/146-the-problem-with-being-present
> A few months ago, I started experimenting with taking fewer photos. It started with a moment of lucidity on, of all places, my yoga mat. I’d only just sat down when I noticed a golden ray of sunlight falling across a stack of books to my left. I reached for my phone camera instinctually, but it wasn’t there. Too humiliated to stand up and get it, I decided to just look instead. (I talked about this moment in a podcast in early February.) Trite as it may sound, that light on those books presented me with an ordinary lesson about presence that, until then, I’d repeatedly failed to internalize. The photo I might have taken, however pretty, would have been useless compared to simply witnessing the beauty in the exact moment it was happening. That, right then, was its greatest purpose. Not as a memory, not as more detritus in my overstuffed camera roll. But simply a moment enjoyed. There was no need to hoard it. There was beauty everywhere. I could find more whenever I wanted.
it appeals very much to the person in me who wants to document everything (see: this monster of a file), and also to the person who was well aware i could've got my camera and shot the burning tree as it curled and singed, but just... eh. didn't want to. it was nice to sit there and take it all in.

5/27 been reading more from that person, it's good. found this through one of the end links https://www.gq.com/story/mary-h-k-choi-on-family-grief-and-love-modern-lovers, and it is also good. I love these works of nonfiction that are basically prose in their own right; the line is so thin anyway

6/5 it is Fascinating listening to a couple songs by Igorrr (contributor to the <i>Brame</i> album) and hearing like. similarities. instruments, riffs, motifs, from aforementioned album. what came first? does it sound less novel/unique when I realize they're part of the usual repertoire? not sure how to  feel about it tbh.
(songs in question: whatever's playing on the videos on [these](https://igorrr.bandcamp.com/album/spirituality-and-distortion) two [pages](https://igorrr.bandcamp.com/album/savage-sinusoid?from=footer-cc-a2855483756)

WHERE THE HELL HAVE I HEARD [THIS ONE](https://venetiansnares.bandcamp.com/track/hajnal) OH MY GOD I *DEFINITELY* DID, LIKE, YEARS AGO. HECK!!

6/6 finished the Igorrr album, it was... kinda eh, tbh? I liked the frenetic pace of the "Very Noise" tune actually, the rest is more vocal-y than I care for. also idk what to make of the fact the comments are like "MOST WTF-INDUCING MUSIC EVER" and I'm like "yeah, the opera with the drums, we've all heard it"

## August,,,
8/03 all but abandoned this note by now but this is a good fucking paragraph:
> Advertising is the art of convincing weak – willed human beings to buy products they don’t need with money they don’t have. It’s a cynical, manipulative industry, where consumerism meets mass media in a matrimony of lies. It preys on our deepest desires, our most basic emotions, throwing away our time and money to give away to anonymous suits who already have plenty of both. Learning to advertise is learning how to psycholigically manipulate people for your own personal gain. It is for this reason that you must learn the trade. Respect the trade. For if you don’t know each and every trick that’s being played off you, then you’ll be just another sheep in this great big herd that is capitalist society.
