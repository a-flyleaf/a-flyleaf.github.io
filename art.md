# Art...?

You might be looking for [the mini-portfolio from 2020]({{site.url}}/shriblets/2020-06-07-art)!

I draw a lot, and it's *way* too much to collect on a single page. I upload new stuff to <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf" target="_blank">deviantArt</a> on a semi-regular basis; besides that, you can see some of my art throughout my [projects]({{site.url}}/projects) and [shriblets]({{site.url}}/shriblets).

Additional pages that may or may not be made eventually:
- general archive/dA backup, for stuff that doesn't fit in elsewhere
- commissioned work, since that's a thing I do once in a blue moon (primarily for <a href="https://flightrising.com/main.php?p=lair&tab=userpage&id=138250" target="_blank">dragon cash</a>); could be folded into general FR art page

~maybe more~
